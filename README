First, build the classes:

  ./build.sh

Then, you have the option of running the full pipeline. This requires about
4 GB of RAM (seriously) and lots of free time. To run it:

  ./run-full.sh <name of product>

e.g.:

  ./run-full.sh iphone 4

Or, you can run the version that uses manually selected review text. For this,
you'll need about 2GB of RAM and maybe half an hour of time:

  ./run-noscraping.sh <data file>

e.g.

  ./run-noscraping.sh data/iphone4.reviewtexts
  ./run-noscraping.sh data/starcraft2.reviewtexts
  ./run-noscraping.sh data/windows7.reviewtexts

Or you can run the version that just does summarization. This version is much
faster.

  ./run-onlysummarize.sh data/iphone4.reviewtexts
  ./run-onlysummarize.sh data/starcraft2.reviewtexts
  ./run-onlysummarize.sh data/windows7.reviewtexts

We've also included some scripts to run a couple of the individual component
tests:

  ./jargon.sh data/iphone4.reviewtexts
  ./summarize.sh data/iphone4.comments
