% Okay guys, let's work ALL TOGETHER on this!
\section{Summary}
CRYBABY -- which we have still yet to determine a suitable acronym for -- is a
system which will identify and summarize common complaints about commercial
products. If common complaints are easy to find, manufacturers could more
easily know what to remedy in later versions of their products.

\section{Goals}
% Is a list here appropriate? I dunno.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Crawl the web for reviews (both professional reviews and user reviews)
\item Extract complaints (or, more generally, expressions of strong opinion)
from these reviews
\item Summarize these complaints
\item Present the results in an understandable fashion
\item Do all of this while maintaining the illusion of competence
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Research}
% Oh man Joshua and Ashwin should put some research here if they have any.
In the area of comment summarization, we plan to heavily draw from the
architecture of LexRank, the system presented in ``LexRank: Graph-based
Lexical Centrality as Salience in Text Summarization''.

\section{Architecture}
Our original architecture proposal had a four-part architecture:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Crawl the web for reviews, and classify them by type of review
(blog post, professional review, store review, etc.)
\item Identify product-specific jargon and its connotations
\item Using these, extract comments from the reviews
\item Summarize these comments and present the summary as output
\end{enumerate}

So far, we feel our basic architecture is sound, although we have run into a
few issues with actually getting reviews and extracting jargon, and we are
considering a reduction in scope to help deal with these issues.
% It would be nice to get some more detail about the problems, and how we plan
% to reduce the scope.

\section{Progress}
% Oh man Joshua and Ashwin should describe their progress here.
Asssuming that the best solution is the simplest solution that works, a
small k-means++ clusterer has been written as the core of our comment
summarizer. Initial results from this, though, have proved disappointing, and
we plan to replace this with a more complex system that is hopefully more
capable.

% TODO: fix this.
On the evaluation data front, we have done absolutely nothing.

\section{Proposed Experiments}
% I dunno what you guys are doing, but this is what I'm doing.

We also plan to try replacing our dumb k-means clusterer with a more intelligent
system based on graph centrality, based on the framework presented by the
LexRank system. Furthermore, we plan on integrating WordNet (or possibly
SentiWordNet) into the system to provide a better method of assessing comment
similarity by considering synonym/antonym pairs, and hierarchical concept
relationships.

\section{Conclusion}
% TODO: have a better conclusion.
We're going to, like, do less than we said we would, m'kay?
