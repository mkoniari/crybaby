\subsection{Jargon Identification} % (fold)

In the jargon identification segment, we have made some changes to the way terms are learned.  We are now using a function to indicate similarity between bags of words:\begin{align*}
	similarity(A, B) &= \frac{|A\cap B|}{|A\cup B|}.
\end{align*}This way, the similarity is always a number between 0 and 1.  We are currently using this similarity measure, with a threshold, to find all similarities between noun phrase bags.  This way, terms like ``battery'' and ``battery life'' can be grouped together, making the program more likely to learn that battery life is an important feature to identify.

One issue that we have noticed is dealing with different versions of the same word (i.e., words with the same stem).  We plan to integrate the Porter Stemmer \cite{porter} into our system to recognize common stems.
