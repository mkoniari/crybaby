"Apple has finally given it to us – sorta"

"If it’s not so great, you’ll have to put up with the same issues I’ve dealt with for years"

"It's a reflex at this point, like John Marston reaching for his gun.I slide the phone back in my pocket.* * *The screen is the first thing I notice, naturally, because it's the one thing I couldn't test when I saw the phone back in April.Cramming more pixels into a smaller space is the opposite of what Apple did with the iPad, which uses a relatively low amount of pixels in a large space"
"So why do both displays look so fantastic?The iPhone 4 has so many more pixels that I can't see them individually with the naked eye"
"When I try I can just begin to defocus my eyes when the phone comes too close to my face"

"Why are there more pixels if I can't see more stuff on the screen"
"Why are there the same same seven rows of text messages and eight rows of items in the iPod app I saw three years ago when there are four times as many pixels"

"It's fun"
"Useful"
"Futuristic"
"Easy"
"My parents could do this"
"(Until they can't, and have to ask me for help.)But the secret is that—when he's not licking me—I'm looking Matt right in the eye"
"The camera and screen are so close that they create the illusion of a camera behind Matt's eyes—so I really feel like we're talking face to face"
"When Skyping someone on a laptop, they're always looking at me on their screen—away from their webcam.I say goodbye to Matt"
"The next time I expect to see his face in a phone conversation will probably be in 2011"
"Voice is enough for most"
"He's not my wife.* * *On a drive in a car that's not my own to a place I don't recognize, the Nexus One is along for the ride"

"It's downscaled from the video's original quality, but still, I'm impressed.I get bored and move on, flipping through honeymoon photos and skimming 720p videos taken in Japan, each pixel a tiny fraction of a wonderful memory that was well worth the lousy exchange rate"
"It makes me wish that I was in Tokyo right now, with their Toto Washlets in every home, office and public facility"
"But then I wonder, how much space are these bigger photos and videos taking?Back at my iMac, I check"
"3.26GB"
"The same photos only took up 1.6GB on the 3GS"
"Videos are a similar story.We're gonna need a bigger NAND.* * *It's not my birthday.I suggested the birthday song as a quick test for voice quality, because it inherently necessitates changes in tone and pitch"
"It's a quick song, out of necessity"
"I'm not sitting through the full eight-and-a-half minute rendition of Won't Get Fooled Again"
"Though making Rosa do that ten times successively might justify the price of the iPhone 4.The call quality testing we did matches what I observed in my own use.My friend seems surprised to hear from me"
"I haven't called him in a while, usually relying on IM and email, because this is 2010 and we are not old"
"Many people are getting called with the iPhone 4 today, in the name of science.More than once my test subjects surprised that I'm switching back and forth between standard hold and speakerphone"
"The dual-microphone noise cancellation setup makes a huge difference for filtering ambient noises from a speakerphone"
"But regular calls aren't much better than before, seeing as I'm not surrounded by vuvuzelas."Thanks, talk to you later"
"Bye bye."I look down, confused"
"Random buttons have been inadvertently pressed by my face"
"My face hasn't changed very much since using the 3GS, just days ago"
"Place this issue among the "to-fix-in-iOS 4.01" pile.* * *I keep hearing variations of the same anecdote when discussing iMovie for iPhone 4"
""You could barely edit movies on a computer ten years ago."My head bobs in agreement"
"Very true"
"I'm surprised at how quick it is, joining clips, adding themes, making titles and transitions"
"Exporting"
"Takes about as long as the clip is, on average resolution.Then I try uploading a natively shot 720p video to YouTube from the phone"
"It's tiny"
"And grainy, even after letting it fully render over a day"
"And fuzzy, and definitely not 720p"
"How could this be"
"Would it be better if I uploaded over Wi-Fi, or emailed it to myself to upload from somewhere else"
"No"
"Every one of those options down-converts before sending it off the phone.I discover that the only way to get the full 720p video from my phone to YouTube is putting it on a computer first"
"Dreams of shooting HD videos from the field, over that faster HSUPA upload, and not having to do extra post-processing at a computer later have vanished"

"He's had to resort to getting a Microcell"
"He tells me he's turned it off.It's six minutes into the call"
"The iPhone 4 is smarter, choosing towers that can actually handle calls, rather than just the one with the strongest signal."Can you hear me"
"I can't hear you."He sounds like he just went into the bathroom, filled his bathtub and dunked himself phone first"
"Sure, he can make calls now, but something's still keeping the phone from making great calls"
"After thirty seconds of this, the connection breaks"
"Maybe we should have used FaceTime.Update: Actually, the 3gs miraculously has 5 bars in his house now, too"
"So it seems like a convenient tower change or installation or upgrade may have occurred recently.* * *I'm reading a chapter of Shit My Dad Says in bed, trying not to disturb the wife"
"There's very little eye strain, though I don't know if I could reach the end of the book reading this way"
"Even for a lover of ebooks, the size of the phone is too small to accurately represent a "book""
"It requires me to turn the page too often, like some iPad mini parody"
"Page turns are actually responsive enough to be pleasant.Added up over a year, I would probably save about seven hours of cumulative time not waiting for book pages to render, apps to load and photos to resize, compared to the 3GS"
"I can't go back.Now to find a use for those seven hours.* * *Is it too thin"
"Is it too delicate"
"I'm afraid of holding it"
"I never used to be.I go to play with my bunny"
"When I pick him up, he squirms as if I'll never let go for all eternity"
"I try to lower myself to the ground as much as possible before he scratches my arms and jumps out of my hands"
"He can adjust his body to land on his feet, absorbing most amount of impact in the least damaging areas.This iPhone cannot"
"The iPhone 4 is not as drop resistant as a rabbit.* * *While the wife's driving the two of us to McDonalds, I take the chance to catch up on email, Twitter, Giz and the latest episode of the Adam Carolla Show, flipping back and forth with fast app switching in iOS 4"
"Doubling the amount of RAM to 512MB is just like gas expanding to fill a vacuum—programs will find a use for it"
"Along with the smoother transitions thanks to the faster processor, every flip between programs is fluid"
"Things are kept fresh, ready for me when I need them.I try to put down the phone, only to get bored and pick it up at the next red light.The last time I charged the phone was yesterday morning, and it's already past noon today"
"20%—not bad"
"Better than the 3GS, because the battery is bigger"
"Still, good thing I turned off Bluetooth.Another red light"
"I'm motion sick...possibly going to vomit"
"But I can't stop playing with the phone.* * *It's Friday night"
"The guy from Hypermac surprises me at my table."You're here with your family?""Yup"
"Did you get your iPhone 4?"He waves takes his out and does the Miss Area Woman local parade wave"
"I smile."Yup."Three years ago a waitress asked to see my first-generation iPhone"
"I showed her"
"Ten minutes went by"
"She forgot to take my order"
"I'd forgotten, too, until she walked away.Tonight's waitress isn't as impressed"
""Oh, is that the new iPhone"
"My boyfriend has the old one"
"Does this one drop fewer calls"
"Well, that's good"
"So what are you having?"The newness is gone, but that doesn't mean people aren't still excited.I text Mark and Matt"
"They both reply within a minute—the fastest I've seen them respond in the last six months"
"It's clear they were both playing with their phones, or at least, had them in reach.* * *I'm taking photos of my food"
"I don't know why—I've been here before, and I'll come back again"
"It has more to do with the act of taking the picture than the result, which is that I have a photo of what I'm about to eat"
""Remember that," I'll think to myself some months down the line"
"But I won't"
"I might not remember how the meal tasted, or what happened, nor do I really need to"
"There's evidence"
"Now the evidence is clearer and more saturated, with the better lens and smarter processing"
"The colors pop"
"They look more delicious than they do when I was actually there.I get up real close to shoot macros of my bunny"
"The camera responds quicker than I'd expect—quicker than other cellphone cams"
"Sometimes, still, not quick enough"
"Bunnies are fast.I get in closer"
"Autofocus kicks in, rendering orange-tinted shots that I will have to fix later in on my computer"
"Wish there was white balance.I get in even closer"
"The limit's reached, and the shots turn out blurry.Bunny sniffs the phone.* * *Everything is more crisp"
"I tap out a message and the new keyboard noises make the old 3GS keyboard noises seem muddy"
"The speakers themselves are more clear as well, but a little softer.The home screen"
"The volume buttons"
"The power button"
"The screen itself"
"Everything is crisper, sharper, more angular"
"All softness is gone"
"The rounded back, an awkward turtle-shell of necessity, is out"
"It's hard"
"It is a hard phone"
"Thirty times harder than plastic, as the too-often repeated marketing phrase goes"
"But hard still shatters, as our own intern Ryan saw.It was designed this way"
"It's probably a mistake.* * *The engineers have lost"
"The industrial designers have won.Antenna problems, confirmed by Apple themselves, are the symptom of a problem that goes into the heart of Apple's product process"
"Right brain won over left brain"
"We all suffer.I'm making a call, trying to adjust myself to the phone, holding it at the top instead of the bottom, so as to not jeopardize reception"
"What happened to Apple's iPad marketing, where the device adjust itself to you"
"Why am I changing the way I've held cellphones for the last decade to avoid a design issue"
"It feels foreign"
"It feels like I might drop my phone.Then I forget"
"My hand slips down to the accustomed position, covering up the antenna with meat and sweat and humanity"
"The call maintains"
"There's ever-so-slightly more distortion in the voice, but I can still hear the other person fine"
"I'm lucky to live in one of AT&T's well-covered areas"
"Those with mediocre reception to begin with see a bigger impact, documented, when they use the death grip.I'm fiddling with the phone over 3G, flipping through maps, searching Twitter, checking mail"
"The otherwise zippy phone feels winded"
"There is no alternative to the death grip when I hold the phone in the left hand and point with the right—that's the only way I can hold the phone.I don't want to get a case.* * *How was my $500 Sanyo camcorder, bought on that trip to Japan, obviated by a 720p cellphone camera"
"The same way point and shoots and Flip minicams are now being eaten into with the camera that everyone has on them—the one on their phone"
"And hell, this phone is actually better than most of those single-use devices.My 1080p Sanyo is fantastic"
"It has one thousand and eighty pees"
"Someone even emailed me to ask what camera it was, when I uploaded my own reception problem video"
"But hell if I ever carry it with me, even if it's only slightly bigger than my fist"
"There's only room for one fist in each of my pockets, and pocket one is spoken for.The iPhone will be there"
"It's the camera that counts, the camera that's with you when you get into a traffic accident, when someone's about to do something stupid, when you're doing something you've never done before.But I have to decide, do I put more consumable content on my phone, or do I save more of that 32GB for making memories?* * *My dad calls"
"He needs his printer fixed, or he forgot how to log into Gmail, or he had a recurrence of old-person syndrome and entirely forgot how to use a computer"
"It doesn't matter which.He asks me about the new iPhone"
"I recommend he doesn't get it."You actually make a lot of phone calls, unlike me"
"Plus, AT&T is lousy where you are"
"Plus there's the reception issue, which gets exacerbated* when there's low signal"
"As for the rest, it's improved in many ways"
"But stick with what you've got now."*** I didn't use the word "exacerbated" over the phone.** Also, this conversation actually occurred in Chinese.* * *FlashI surprise, no, shock, my wife with the iPhone flash in the dark"
"She is not amused"
"I am"
"I am a child.There's now light where there was no light before"
"Drunken New York bar exploits will be all the clearer now, illuminating various conquests, trophies mounted on Facebook the next morning, all with tiny pupils adjusting to the harsh glare"
"It's not perfect, but it's better than not having a flash.I imagine thousands of these damn iPhone flashes at the next basketball game I go to, illuminating all of a full three feet ahead of these people, making the back of the bald guy's head in Row 27 look amazingly clear"
"Kobe, on the other hand, will still be lit just fine by the fluorescent bulbs of the Staples Center.* * *I keep picking up the phone, looking inside, and finding things to do"
"I want to use it.I can't go back to the 3GS"
"The speed, the camera, the screen, the non-humpback, the video chatting"
"Once you have it, you can't give it up.But I'm scared"
"Not of dropping calls because I'm holding it wrong—I don't make a lot of them, and when I do, they're not so critical that I can't call someone back"
"Plus, I have a Batphone landline and work at home"
"I'm scared for data"
"I can never hold the phone naturally because I'm afraid I'm getting a quarter of the speeds I was getting before"
"Like a parent with a child too lazy or too difficult to live up to his potential, I'm frustrated and confused and sad"
"You love it too much, and you can't give it up, but something's wrong"
"So like most, I focus on the good qualities"
"The speed, the camera, the screen"
"So what if he throws a tantrum when I hold him wrong"
"He's my boy.The iPhone 4 is the culmination of years of refining Apple's iPhone line of products.One by one, Apple has improved features and the latest iteration enhances a number of important elements like display, camera (with Flash), dual-microphone, larger battery and multi-tasking - just to cite a few.The design itself has been updated to use steel and aluminosilicate glass, which is ultra-resistant to scratches (but not shocks)"
"The new antenna design has been generating a ton of controversy recently because of interferences caused by the contact between the user's hand and the phone itself"
"So, how bad is it"
"I will tell you what works and what doesn't, without sugar-coating or politics"
"Let's dive in.Context: First of all, I have received a ton of emails asking when this review would come out"
"Sorry for the wait, but I wanted to use the phone for a while to let the hype/excitement/first impressions go"
"Thanks for your patience.We all use our phones differently, so it's important that I tell you where I come from: I have been using the iPhone 4 for weeks as my main phone"
"I typically check my email often with Exchange, and I reply moderately because the virtual keyboard is not as productive as a physical one"
"I browse the web several times a day to check on news sites, but I rarely watch movies or play music"
"I don't call much - maybe 10mn a day, if at all"
"This usage pattern will affect battery life and my perception of which features are useful (or not).Technical HighlightsDroid Incredible	iPhone 4Android 2.1 + HTC Sense	iOS 43.7" AMOLED 480x800	3.5" LCD IPS 640x960Qualcomm 8650 SnapDragon, 1Ghz	Apple A4, N/A512MB RAM	512MB RAM8GB internal + microSD slot	16GB of internal storage8 Megapixel camera	5 Megapixel cameraWifi b/g, BT 2.1+EDR, aGPS	Wifi b/g/n, BT 2.1+EDR, aGPSFM Radio	No RadioTV Out (microUSB)	via iPhone connectorCarrier: Verizon, 3G speeds	AT&T4.6 x 2.3 x 0.47", 4.6oz	4.5 x 2.31 x 0.37", 4.5oz1300mAh battery	N/ADesign (excellent)The iPhone 4 design takes the "pure" shape of the iPhone to the next levelYou have all seen the new design for months now (sic), so I won't be spending a whole of time to describe it, the photo gallery is there for that"
"Instead I would like to spend time talking about how it feels to use it.If you thought that the iPhone 3GS was thin, think againThin: If you have been using an iPhone 3GS before, the iPhone 4 is noticeably thinner"
"The management of the internal volume is pretty amazing, and I'm not using that word lightly"
"The industrial design is excellent, although the antenna issues tones it down a little"
"Among the things that I really like in this design are the buttons: on/off, volume +/- are very easy to "feel" with the fingers and to use"
"This is something that most competitors often screw up"
"I use the power button dozens of times a day, so it should be nice and easy to reach.After weeks of use without a case, the glass is still pristineScratch-proof?: The glass in the back is ultra-resistant"
"It is comparable in hardness to Sapphire, which is so hard that it's practically impossible to scratch it"
"After months of use, the back of the phone should look a whole lot better than the plastic body of the 3GS"
"This should help the device retain a high resale value"
"Now this (almost) scratch-proof surface comes with one weakness: it is brittle"
"Yes, if you drop it (a couple of times), it will probably crack.."
"so don't.The iPhone feels really good in the hand, although I wouldn't mind a 4.3" modelFeels good: The body of the iPhone 4 is very thin, much thinner than the iPhone 3GS, which was already considered to be very slim"
"At first, it's a little weird because despite the smaller volume, the weight stays the same"
"The iPhone 4 feels incredibly dense and solid"
"I got used to it after a few hours"
"The good news is that even with a case on, it should stay very compact.New hardware platform: The iPhone 4 comes with Apple's A4 processor, as found on the iPad and it also packs 512MB of memory, which is twice as much as the iPhone 3GS"
"The additional memory is probably most useful to accommodate the new multi-task capabilities of the iPhone 4, but it might also bring some added performance to the system"
"The A4 processor should also be faster than its predecessor (the phone does feel faster) but speed was usually not a real issue on the 3GS, so the difference is not eye-popping.Bumper: To alleviate shocks when the phone gets dropped, Apple has invented the "bumper", a plastic piece that goes all around the phone"
"It comes in different colors (orange, blue, pink, green, white, black)"
"I have played with the black bumper, and I sure wish that I won't have to use it"
"It is probably efficient at what its doing, but it hides the steel band, which is one of the best feature of the phone, I think"
"Also, the metals feels much better than the Bumper's plastic.Apple A4 processor: You will see a ton of articles saying that both the iPhone 4's A4 processor and the iPhone 3GS Samsung processor are based on an ARM Cortex A8 design - this keep coming, and coming.."
"Well, that's true, but it means.."
"*nothing*"
"As I have said before, smartphone chips are pretty much the equivalent of a PC motherboard, complete with CPU, GPU, RAM and other co-processors"
"The CPU, the Cortex A8 is one among many blocks within the chip"
"Telling you that a PC has a Core i5 processor doesn't tell you much about its overall capabilities - it's the same for the smartphone chip"
"Maybe it has a few dedicated co-processors that make video and 3D graphics zippy"
"Or maybe the bus linking all the parts is super fast and let data flow freely"
"Or maybe the individual blocks have been designed to be shut down at any moment to save more power"
""Based on an ARM Cortex A8" tells you none of that, so in the future, just discard that stuff when you see it"
"What you're buying is the overall experience anyway.Retina display (excellent)That was about time: the iPhone display had not changed since its launchThe Retina display makes everything look much smootherHigh-resolution: The Retina display is one of the major improvements of the iPhone 4 design"
"With 960x640 pixels, it has a higher resolution than competitors (800x480) which is great because higher resolution directly impacts the usability of every text-based application (web, email, eBooks...), and the quality of video playback (details...)"
"In practical terms, the Retina Display brings a slightly better user experience than 800x480 displays, especially when there is small text involved"
"The jump forward from the iPhone 3GS is simply gigantic, also because the 3GS was a little bit short in pixels.Left: Droid Incredible, Right: Retina Display as seen by my cameraBoth are set to maximum brightnessVersus OLED: I often get the question about how the LCD-IPS Retina Display compares to OLED (or AMOLED, Super-AMOLED etc.."
"I'll just call them all "OLED" for simplicity's sake even if there are differences)"
"There a few things that I like considering: contrast, brightness and direct sunlight readability -- with the latter being the most important.In my opinion, the iPhone 4 does better with the direct sunlight test when compared to recent high-end phones like the Droid Incredible (OLED) or the EVO 4G (LCD)"
"When reading emails, only the Blackberry Bold 9700 does better because the BB9700's display is really good for black text on a white background - which is weird because it uses Transmissive LCD"
"Anyway, I would give the advantage to the iPhone Retina Display over its immediate competitors.I hate writing about color "accuracy" with phones because I don't have a good setup to test it, but I think that it is fair to talk about the image quality (according to my own preferences)"
"The iPhone 4's contrast (black look really black) and saturation are not as good as the Droid Incredible's OLED display"
"On the Incredible blacks are more black and not dark grey"
"However, the Retina display doesn't look "washed out" either"
"OLED also produces more saturated colors, sometime overly saturated to the point of looking "bizarre""
"I've discussed this about the Samsung Wave's Super-AMOLED back in Feb 2010.Left: Droid Incredible, right: iPhone 4 in direct sunlight at max"
"brightnessI'd say that iPhone 4 winsOverall, the Retina display has a few drawbacks common to LCD technology, namely the contrast and saturation"
"However, the choice of going with LCD-IPS has a few advantages"
"For one, it provides a better readability in direct sunlight than competing phones"
"Secondly, there's no 3.5" OLED display with a 960x640 pixels"
"Finally, Samsung does not have the capacity to produce OLED displays for its own phones and Apple's anyway.Basics (very good)Apple pretty much built its phone business around the fact that its user interface made people go from "hating their phones" to "loving them", so let's inspect the basic stuff:All the basic stuff work very well"
"No sweatDialing: Upon launching the phone app, it's very easy to dial a number, call a favorite, look at the recent calls, find a contact or check on voicemail"
"The phone stuff is well covered, and not much has changed since the previous iPhone"
"Usually, I dial from the favorites, but searching one in hundreds of contacts is fairly quick too (I use the Universal Search for that)"
"Going to and from Speaker Mode is dead simple as well"
"I don't expect anyone to have issued with the basic dialing and calling mechanism.My Death Grip in action, certainly easier to do than the Death TouchWireless reception & "death grip": Given the recent antenna problems that we've covered all too often, this is a sticky point"
"To make things clear: the iPhone 4 has *two issues* in regards to reception:1/When the user grabs the phone, the human body effectively connects the two antennas (wifi & 3G), which impacts the reception quality (a.k.a "death grip")"
"For iPhone 4s already in the wild, this can by avoided only by using a case/bumper, applying a non-conductive material or by holding it differently.."
"(scream now)"
"How could Apple not realize what was going on"
"Maybe because the company tests its products with a case.."
"Still, this seems silly that it wasn't caught during the design process.2/The method used to display the reception "bars" has been "completely wrong" according to Apple itself"
"Problem #2 compounds with problem #1 because it makes the signal reduction even more dramatic, but at least, there's a software fix coming for #2"
"Update 7/16/2010: This has been fixed by iOS 4.0.1This video shows the effect of the "Death Grip""
"Although it does notsuppress voice calls (for me), it did suppress dataFirst-hand report: I have witnessed the "death grip" myself, and while I have yet to drop a phone call because of it, I have seen my phone data download speed going from 1.3Mbps download down to zero"
"The death grip will happen in areas where coverage is already weak so it's hard to to reproduce it in a consistent way but it does exist and it needs a hardware fix.Immediate fix: Apple has notoriously told users to "hold their phones differently" or to use a case that will prevent the human body from causing electrical interferences"
"Many people will use a case anyway, so that's not a big deal for them, but for those of us who don't want to use a case (like me!), a thin protective layer should do the trick, although I have not tested that myself, others that I trust have done it"
"In any case, this is something that Apple will have to improve/fix in an upcoming design refresh - "don't hold it that way" is just not good enough.Reality: Drama aside, the issue is not as bad as it sounds: at the moment, I have not been in a situation where I missed calls, but if data starts to get slow, this is the first thing that comes to mind: "try holding it differently""
"I got that once in downtown SF, and it turned out that the network sucked (data and voice), regardless of how I hold it"
"Still, the Death Grip does come to mind each time.."
"Overall, I would say that things have been working quite decently.Action item: Consumer Reports have said that they "cannot recommend the iPhone 4" while the death grip issue stands"
"Instead, they tell people to go for the iPhone 3GS"
"In my opinion, this is bad advice"
"I recommend you to either wait for the problem to be 100% fixed, or just to go for it, because from all the field reports, the phone is actually very much usable"
"In any case, you should *not* lock yourself up with a previous-gen phone for 2-years because of the death grip"
"If you're unsure, stay out of the game until the dust settles.Update 7/16/2010: Apple has said that it will give free cases to every iPhone 4 customers until Sept 30"
"The company will re-evaluate the situation then"
"Customers whoe arent happy with the phone can return it free of charge, within 30 days"
"More details in our antennagate coverage.Each and every time, the iPhone 4 wins against the 3GSData speed: Despite the Death Grip issue, the data speed is much better when compared to the iPhone 3GS"
"When using the Cisco broadband speed test, the iPhone 4 is always noticeably faster (about 30%) than the 3GS"
"In any case, the progress is significant and I have been impressed by the numbers reported by the Cisco benchmark"
"I would have loved to see the same app on Android, but I dont, so I'll stop the comparison here as comparing bandwidth numbers across different tests is certainly not reliable.Audio quality: The call audio quality is very decent, although I find it to be on the soft side"
"The same is true for the speaker phone function"
"I wish that it was louder.The iPhone 4 virtual keyboard has not changed from previous modelsVirtual keyboard: The iPhone virtual keyboard is very good for two reasons: 1/ it is very responsive (especially when compared to the HTC Sense one), 2/It is not visually noisy"
"Obviously, both are a matter of personal perception and preferences, but I've seen my share of phones and recently, the Motorola Droid X virtual keyboard is the one that I would like the most for the above reasons"
"From a pure productivity standpoint, larger phones like the Droid X have an edge, simply because they are bigger so my rate of error goes down.Notice how visually busier the Incredible keyboard is"
"It's also slower to reactBlackberry keyboard users: you will simply have to realize that you won't type as fast"
"At times, it is frustrating, but in the end, you will have to decide if you want the extra typing speed, or if you would rather have a phone that is much better at *everything* except text communications"
"In my case, I have realized that I was using my phone more and more for things other than email and SMS.Virtual keyboard advice: don't be afraid to press with the whole tip of your finger"
"The software does a good job of guessing where you were trying to tap.On touchphones, the iPhone has the most consistent implementation of Copy/PasteCopy/paste: At this point, I think that the iPhone has the best and most consistent copy/paste interface"
"The second in line is HTC Sense, which replicates the functionality *almost* identically.The web browsing experience is great - except that Flash won't work (ever)Web browsing: It's not news that the iPhone does provide an excellent web browsing experience, but the high-resolution display does make it that much better"
"There is less zooming involved (if you have a good sight)"
"And when you zoom, I like the fact that things don't jump around like they do on Android: Android browsers tend to wrap the text around by default, which is not fundamentally bad, but it does make the page content move around, so it's hard to choose a point to zoom towards"
"Other than that, the browsing experience on Android 2.x and on the iPhone 4 are both very good.This is a Flash games site.."
"as you can see, this is not happeningFlash: Apple has said that its products won't be supporting Flash inside the browser (or apps...)"
"As Flash starts to creep into other mobile devices, is this a big deal"
"Not for now, but it might be in the future"
"As far as I have seen on other devices, when Flash sites do work, the performance is currently too low to make them desirable to me"
"Also, sites like YouTube have rolled out HTML 5 versions that can run on the iPhone"
"So, in practical terms, Flash on mobile doesn't make my life a whole lot better - yet, and that's mainly because it is still too slow.Eventually, phones will get faster, have multiple cores, more memory and so on.."
"and Flash will start to show its full potential on mobiles"
"There is no question that I would like to watch occasional videos from Tech Ticker or CNBC on my phone, but at this point, the lack of Flash is not something that will threaten Apple"
"Also, many services might have an App equivalent, so don't sweat it just yet, but keep an eye on the situation.Google docs: As usual, Google docs web documents are read-only (except for spreadsheets), but the extra-resolution makes the reading more comfortable"
"I would love to get editing capabilities from the browser"
"In the meantime, there are paid apps like Document To Go that can help"
"All in all, I think that editing from within an application provides a much better experience"
"Web apps are still slow and their user interfaces are often ill-suited for anything else than reading text.Proximity sensor issues: There have been reports of issues with the proximity sensor not working properly during calls"
"That results in having your face/ears press random buttons, leading to undesired behaviors (like hanging up on someone)"
"Fortunately, it has not happened to me, although this does not mean that it doesn't exist or doesn't happen at all"
"I just have not experienced it first hand"
"If you do, the suggested fix is to power down and reboot your iPhone 4"
"At the moment, I don't think that Apple has an official answer to this"
"Google search about this topicBattery Life (awesome)During my test, I got two solid days of normal use, and I got by one very busy day wihtout a problem"
"So much better than the 3GS, it's not funny.The battery life is one of the most important feature of any phone, because we rely so much on our phones being always-on"
"In this 4th iteration of the iPhone, Apple has managed to include a larger battery, which is simply the best way to tackle the energy issue at this point"
"Also, the company has now switched to using its own A4 processor that I suspect has been very optimized for ultra-low power consumption during "standby mode".Average (48 hrs): The net result is an awesome battery life of about 2 days (48 hours) of normal use for me (including sleep time) - read the "context" paragrah to know what "normal use" means to me.Standby mode (250+ hrs): battery went from 100% down to 94% after 15hrs"
"That would imply a standby time of 250hours (10.4 days)"
"Note that the battery rate of decay is usually linear for electronic devices (in a given mode), but because I have measured on only the first 6%, drop, there is some margin for error"
"You get the picture, though.Music (36.6 hrs): During music playback (screen OFF), the iPhone's battery depletes at a rate of 1% every 22mn"
"If you extrapolate this, you get something like 36.6hours of music playback"
"Which is close enough of the 40 hours advertised by Apple.Video (to be updated): I don't want to hold the publication of this review any longer, but I will update this section within 48 hrs"
"Right now, I expect to see 8-10 hrs video playback.Bottom-line: The iPhone 4 will easily hold during an very busy day, and if I use it only casually, it can last a couple of days before finally shutting down"
"Some sites have reported getting 4 days out of it, but in my case, I get about 48 hours at most"
"Obviously, you can tell that things can vary wildly as the phone can stay alive for 10 days in standby mode.Although recent Android phones have come long way with the "standby mode", I don't think that any will last for as long as the iPhone 4 with the same usage pattern"
"If you want to save power, you can also turn WiFi off"
"Most of the time, I don't even use it these days.I wish that the iPhone had a power widget that lets me easily manage power features (GPS, WIFI, BT, 3G, Brightness) like Android has"
"This would make things even better, but at this point, it is fair to say that the iPhone is the king of the hill in terms of battery life.USB Charging: unlike the iPad, the iPhone 4 can be charged via any standard USB port (PC, USB HUB...)"
"Now, we would sure love it if the iPhone was using a standard micro-USB for that purpose, but this will certainly not happen"
"Fortunately, you can get iPhone USB cables for cheap ($2) on Amazon - that's what I did.Email (very good)This is a promotional email from iTunes"
"Overall, email is really good.Ever since iOS has supported Microsoft Exchange, I found the iPhone to be a very capable email system that is largely good enough for my personal and professional needs (I get a ton of emails and use the calendar quite intensely)"
"The iPhone is making inroads in corporate accounts because 1/users want the phone 2/it lets you connect to multiple accounts, including multiple Exchange accounts"
"RIM (the company behind Blackberry) should take notice of this...Overall, the email experience is very good (except for the lower-speed typing), and the ability to arrange emails per thread can be useful if a conversation is spread out overtime"
"The email search is also integrated in the Mail app (unlike Android's equivalent) and the search is very fast"
"Finally, common attachments like photos show up in cleanly"
"I would rank the iPhone second, after Blackberry in terms of email efficiency.Synchronization (mixed)Content/Apps Synchronization: iTunes is the real power behind the success of the iPod as it did let users go trough the full "content cycle": Find, Download, Sync, Consume"
"Despite all the criticism that it is taking for being big and slow, iTunes is a good companion to the iPhone"
"It lets you copy compatible content like select music and video files, but also perform admin tasks like backups and icon management"
"As long as you stay within iTunes, life is good and easy.USB sync / general data synchronization: Because the iPhone relies greatly on iTunes to move files in and out, don't expect it to behave like a USB drive in which you can drag and drop whichever files you want"
"You can add predefined types of files to your iPhone into the iTunes library, but iTunes will do a sanity check before adding them"
"If iTunes determines that the file won't be recognized by the device or by one of the apps, it won't copy it.The only thing that you can access is the photo directory, in read-only mode, to export photos like you would from a USB key or a memory card"
"You cannot copy photos to the iPhone with a Drag & Drop outside of iTunes -- why would you ask"
"Probably because if you start copying files without iTunes knowing about them, it makes iTune's sync much harder.I would really love to be able to use a partition as a generic USB storage"
"It seems like it should be possible to do so, without creating any security issues"
"There are workarounds and apps to do that, but it should really be in iOS.Tethering (3G modem)Using the iPhone 4 as a modem is extremely easy"
"Bye bye USB modem!It is possible for users to tether the iPhone to a computer to use it as a 3G modem either via Bluetooth, or over USB.If you tether using the USB cable, it can't get much easier: Just make sure that you have iTunes 9.2 because the iPhone 4 modem drivers come with it"
"On the iPhone, go to Settings>Network>Internet Tethering>ON"
"Connect the iPhone, and a new network connection will be created instantly"
"It's a breeze when compared to most USB modems"
"I tried it on both Windows 7 and Mac OS, and in both case, things worked out very easily.If you use a Bluetooth connection, there is an extra step of pairing the devices"
"If you attend conferences, I would strongly recommend pairing the laptop to the iPhone 4 *before* being in a room full of Bluetooth devices: Bluetooth devices tend to enumerate all the devices around, and if the place is crowded, chances are that it will take much more time.Tethering works great, but now that the unlimited data plan from AT&T is gone (for new subscribers), it looks like you should only use it casually"
"That's OK with me, and now I can get rid of my USB modem and save an extra $60/mo as long as I stay within my 2GB per month.Imaging (excellent)I am impressed by the iPhone camera low-light capabilitiesPhoto capture: The new camera and the LED flash are both a very good upgrade"
"I found the photos taken with the iPhone 4 to be very high-quality (for a mobile), especially those in low-light"
"Now, snapping a photo in a party or at a dimly lit table is no longer a problem, and that's great"
"The photos can get somewhat noisy, but it's normal and on a small screen they will usually look great"
"Once resized for Facebook, most of the noise will go away too"
"The single LED is good enough for me, especially for shots at less than 1 yard"
"The LED flash can also be used as a Flashlight, which is really cool (there's an app for that)"
"I have uploaded a photo gallery, so take a look"
"Best of all, the camera app reacts very quickly and does not spend a few seconds to adjust after you have tapped to initiate the capture.A photo shot without Flash, at night in downtown San DiegoCheck this photo gallery, or look at the native pcitures in FlickrVideo capture: There was a time when I had a small digital camera to snap 720p videos, but this time is clearly over"
"The iPhone 4 is the first phone (that I have reviewed) that actually records good 720p videos"
"Other phones usually trade framerate (fps) for higher resolution, and that's not acceptable"
"When I say "good 720p videos", I mean that if I showed you the footage in Quicktime or Windows Media Player, you would think that it was shot by a decent MP4 camcorder"
"Anyway, I am very impressed with the video recording quality of the iPhone 4 - including in dim lighting"
"Wow"
"I have uploaded samples for you to look at on Flickr"
"Let me know what you think.If you share a video directly from the iPhone, it will appear in low-resolution in YouTube"
"FAILYouTube upload limitation (Nooooooo): It's great to capture 720p videos, but the iPhone 4 doesn't let you upload 720p videos directly to YouTube"
"Instead, you have to retrieve the video on a computer and upload it from there"
"That kills the fun.Was this done to protect AT&T's wireless network from a surge of data usage (even though it's capped!)"
"Probably"
"In that case, why not authorize 720p upload over WIFI"
"With the capping in place, I don't get the logic of this move"
"Are we going to get MB/hr allotments next?Performance (Very good)Apple does little to enlighten us on what's inside its A4 processor, but the fact is that starting with the iPhone 3GS, iPhones have been the most responsive devices when it comes to user interface, which is I think a key element to making things intuitive.The user interface is crisp and reacts at 60 frames per second (or so)User Interface responsiveness: Some dismiss the importance of having a very responsive phone, but I simply disagree: any form of interaction should yield an immediate result"
"To a degree, people can demonstrate some patience after clicking something because we got so used to waiting after computers in the past decades"
"However, when you are using a touchscreen, the expectation is that the device will do exactly as your finder "does""
"In the past many phones have failed that test"
"In recent months, Android phones have largely closed in, but the responsiveness of Android has not yet caught up with the iPhone 4, and only the Zune HD can claim to be as fast when it comes to the user interface.Raw processing performance: There are no cross-platform benchmarks that allow us to compare the iPhone 4 with Android competitors, but we can compare it with the iPhone 3GS using Geekbench 2 (Geekbench 2 app), and we can try looking at things like games to get an idea of what it can do"
"Geekbench 2 for iPhone simply tries to measure how fast the main processor is, and ignores other hardware features (3D, video encode/decode...)"
"From that perspective, the iPhone 4 is about 30% faster than the iPhone 3GS"
"That is largely due to Apple's A4 processor and a 2X memory boost on the iPhone 4.Gaming: To check on the 3D graphics, I tried playing Real Racing, a 3D racing game"
"I came away pretty impressed"
"It is much more fluid than Raging Thunder under the Droid Incredible, although I will stop the comparison there as this is not the same game"
"What I do know is that it provides a comparable experience, with a seemingly superior framerate, so the conclusion is that the iPhone 4 ranks among the top hardware platform when it comes to 3D.This video shows how fast 3D games can be"
"Not bad at all, right?Boot time: The iPhone 4 boots in boots in 27 seconds"
"It's 10 seconds faster than the Motorola Droid"
"On the extreme opposite, the Blackberry Bold 9700 boots in about 5 minutes.."
"ouch.MultitaskingMulti-tasking is finally here"
"Purists will criticize the trade offs, but if works for most usersBefore iOS 4, iPhone users could only run one app at a time"
"For example, if you are on IM, and someone asks you for an information that is in an email, you had to shut down the IM app, then open the Mail app, copy/paste the info, then close Mail, Re-launch IM, re-Login etc.."
"This could be quite painful"
"Also, if you were listening to music in an Internet Radio app, going to your email would stop the music and shut down the music app"
"Argh.With multi-tasking finally available, developers can build apps that will run in the background with functionalities staying alive if the user switches to something else"
"Typical examples include music services apps, or GPS-tracking programs"
"It will take some time before most apps (that need it) use multi-tasking"
"Also, the multi-tasking functionality itself is limited to the most common use cases: audio, gps, voice over IP (VOIP) and a few more"
"When put to use, this should be enough to satisfy the large majority of users, but I'm still waiting for apps like Skype to fully use multi-tasking"
"To switch from one app to another, you can double-tap the Home button.Out of the box, multi-tasking bring you a much faster task-switching mechanism"
"There's less time spent closing and opening the apps as their "current state" will simply be saved, to be quickly re-activated later - this is much better than a complete shut down and relaunch"
"A few audio/radio apps have already surfaces and GPS apps already exist to take advantage of the new functionality.This is not "true" multi-tasking, so you will be hearing people argue against its limitations, but on the other hand, those trade offs allow the iPhone 4 to have a better battery life and I'm sure that this is something that's more important to most users than "true" multi-tasking, for the sake of it.A corner case for example, is that video playback will stop as soon as you switch to another task, so if you're using a music video clip to actually "listen" to music, the audio will stop too.EntertainmentThe iPhone photo gallery remains one of the most responsive out therePhoto Gallery: the iPhone photo gallery remains of of the best photo gallery, along with the Zune HD photo gallery"
"It is smooth and fluid, even if you have a lot of photos in the device"
"Sharing photos via email/MMS is easy, but there is no Facebook sharing directly from the photo app"
"That's kind of annoying to me, because FB is the place where I share my mobile photos"
"It would be best if developers could plug themselves in the photo app.Music has not changed much, but did it need to?Music: the iPod function is a classic, and it works very well"
"You can arrange your media by Playlist and search by Artist, Song, Audiobook, Genre or simply do a search"
"Given the market penetration of iPods, I doubt that anyone would have a problem using this"
"Music is pretty much a solved problem"
"Note that there's a "Genius" function with which Apple can recommend songs based on what you're listening"
"Other platform usually don't have something like that built-in.Downloaded videos look beautiful on the Retina DisplayVideo playback (from local storage): The iPhone 4 is an excellent video player, and so far, it has been able to play all the MP4 files that I had on hand"
"The playback quality is perfectly smooth, with high framerates (30fps)"
"I don't have an exhaustive list of formats that iTunes will accept, but here's what I have used for this test:740x800 MP4, 2513kbps, 30fps, 48Khz stereo audio368x208 MP4, 855kbps, 29fps, 48Khz stereo audio - PSP videoThe high-resolution display works wonderfully and the end-result is sharper than the Droid Incredible for example, but when I showed the side by side view to "non-techies", most don't spot the difference in sharpness, but they see that the colors look different (it always does).The bottom-line is that the iPhone 4 and iTunes do recognize for MP4 formats than the HTC Incredible for example"
"This is a software issue that I hope HTC will address in the future.The speaker sound is very decent, but I wish that it was louderSpeaker: The speaker audio quality is good, even if it's not loud enough (it never is, really)"
"In relatively quiet environment, you can definitely enjoy a goodYouTube: great with WIFI, too blurry over 3GYouTube: With WiFi, Youtube HD movies are smooth, fluid and beautiful, there's no question about that"
"However, over 3G, the streaming will happen in low-resolution mode even if the phone's raw bandwitdh would be capable of streaming a higher-resolution video"
"This probably comes down to the fact that the unlimited data plans are gone"
"It's too bad because if I have a WIFI connection, I probably have access to a laptop as well - or maybe that's just me"
"Outside of a hotspot youtube looks actually pretty bad"
"I made a video so that you can see what I'm seeing.This video shows that over 3G, the iPhone 4 was streaming a low-resolution versionwhile the Droid Incredible could stream HD"
"Over WiFi, the Retina Display makesthe video look better on the iPhone 4"
"I have never seen YouTube HD over 3G on the i4MiscWith Folders, you can download a ton of apps, without the messFolders: For those who have been downloading a ton of apps, it might be annoying to scroll across many screens to find an app"
"To fix that, Apple has introduced Folders in iOS 4"
"You can now short apps by types in a way that you are most familiar with on your computer"
"To create a folder, you can simply drag one app icon onto another"
"iOS will name the folder based on the application type from the App Store"
"You can change the name if you want.Folders extend how many apps you can have in the system: 180 folders, 12apps/folder = 2160 apps.Things that could be betterAntenna: The "death grip" issue is having a real effect on data download speeds"
"I think that this might (I emphasize on might) be fixed by applying a coating to the steel antenna to prevent electrical interferences from the user's body.Network: AT&T's network could also be better"
"Granted, they do take more hits than other networks, but come on, aren't they actually making money from their customers"
"The bottom-line is that we all expect the network to function, especially now that AT&T has some fairly drastic bandwidth caps.YouTube 720p upload: obviously, we would love to be able to share those 720p movies in their full glory without having to copy the files to a computer first.YouTube 720p viewing (over 3G): Again, now that we have the bandwidth cap, can't I manage my consumption myself"
"Why am I forced to look at a blurry video over 3G?Call volume: the ear-speaker could be louder"
"It's not a huge problem, but that would be very nice in a noisy place.App-Killer: I would like to be able to kill all the apps in one click in the multitask menu.Wish listUnlimited data plan: I hope that an unlimited option will return for power users"
"If it does, things like YouTube videos uploads could be used at their full potential.You know what"
"I'm really starting to like these bigger smartphonesBigger screen: After using large display touch phones like the HTC EVO 4G or the Motorola Droid X, I'm thinking that a larger 4.3" iPhone would be *fantastic* to use"
"Don't you?Slider keyboard: This is probably blasphemy in Cuppertino, but believe me there's a big crowd out there that would love to have an iPhone with a physical keyboard"
"Given how thin the iPhone 4 is, it is hard to imagine that it's not possible to create an iPhone with a physical keyboard"
"that's more of a wish than an improvement, but I'll throw it out there.Plans (cheaper, limited)With its latest pricing, AT&T has chosen to let customers opt for cheaper data plans, but the carrier has also removed the unlimited data plan"
"Now, you can choose between 200MB and 2GB for prices ranging from $15 to $25 per month"
"Tethering on the 2GB data plan will cost $20 more"
"If you go beyond your allotment, you will be charged for another chunk, at the same price"
"Obviously, we would all like to get unlimited data, but that's now off the table"
"If that's really what you need, Sprint might be your best option.Personally, I don't use that much data: probably less than 1GB per month, so I'm OK with the 2GB plan"
"If all you do is email, and a little web browsing, the 200MB plan could even be good enough"
"You still have the option to switch from one plan to the other at any time, and I think that AT&T would pro-rate it, but don't take my word for it and always check with AT&T.FaceTime (good stuff comes free)I'm taking a shot of an intercontinental FaceTime call with Franck/Giiks.comFaceTime is an internet video-call feature of the iPhone 4: it lets two iPhone 4 users place a video call, but only over WIFI"
"The advantage of FaceTime is that there is no setup whatsoever and it work across carriers too"
"Facetime is very fun to use"
"During the iPhone launch, Steve Jobs said that he expected the feature to eventually work over 3G"
"In fact, it could today, but AT&T would go beserk if Apple would do this today"
"Note that FaceTime does not use wireless minutes, so we're talking about free calls here, including international (FaceTime) calls: I tried placing a FaceTime call to Europe.Open standard: the good news is that Apple will let other services connect to FaceTime, so it's not impossible that Fring, Skyp, Yahoo IM or MSN would one day work with FaceTime"
"That would encompass not only computers, but also other video-call capable mobile phones.Obviously, video calls are not a new concept"
"Carriers and handset makers have tried for years to sell it to the public, in vain"
"Why"
"Because it wasn't good enough, and because people were not willing to pay an extra for it"
"FaceTime brings quality and simplicity, and video-calls actually look very good - at no extra cost"
"You see the added-value, right?Battery warning: free calls are an excellent thing, but before you go nuts with FaceTime, I'll point out that it consumes a lot more power than a regular voice call"
"It has to compress audio and video in realtime, so I would eyeball the battery cost at 1% per minute, or something like that.Is it very cool"
"Yes"
"Is it a game-changer"
"Not yet, but it's a great "nice to have" (and it's free)"
"Now, it would be even better if we were allowed to video-chat over 3G, but don't count on that anytime soon.."
"AT&T can't handle it anyway.AppsLook at it any way you want, today, on average, apps on iPhone are better"
"A lot of popular apps that I use (Facebook, Yelp...) are better on the iPhone"
"Google Maps and GMail are better on Android (what a surprise...), but it is really up to you to take a good look at what you need and find out what the best platform is for you.iBooks look good and has a shelf for PDF files"
"wOOt!iBooks has recently been made available to the iPhone, so I had to take a look"
"It looks just like the iPad version and can handle both pure text and text+image documents"
"With the Retina Display, iBooks is actually usable on the iPhone"
"I don't think that the experience on the 3GS would be nearly as compelling"
"Alternatives include the Kindle and the B&N reader.MS Office files (read-only): Natively, you don't have a good option to edit Office documents"
"However, there are many apps out there that claim to give you that functionality"
"I have not tried it for myself, so I won't recommend any apps"
"The good news is that iOS supports Office documents in read mode"
"If you send a Word, Excel or PowerPoint file, it should open.This video shows a PDF in iBooks"
"It also demonstrates how Kindle looksPDF (great!): iOS also supports PDF files natively, so PDF attachement in emails will open nicely"
"Also, you can now choose to save the attached PDFs in iBooks, so that's pretty much great"
"This is coming to the iPad soon.ConclusionIf you're getting a new iPhone, there's no reason to get a 3GS, go iPhone 4The iPhone 4 is an excellent smartphone, the best one in fact"
"This is quite a step up from the iPhone 3GS, thanks to the display and the many improvements in the OS"
"If you don't have an iPhone but want to get one, I would recommend the iPhone 4 over older models, despite the antenna issue"
"If you are thinking of saving $100 by going with the 3GS, take a good look at the total cost of ownership over 2-years"
"You might realize that $100 is not that much of a stretch if you consider that you will be using the device *everyday*"
"Instead, cut down on yourStarbucks consumption to make up for it"
"The pricing of the iPhone 4 is very comparable to other smartphones, so I don't think that pricing should be a decisive factor"
"Instead, the design, user interface, app library and responsiveness will determine if it works for you or not"
"If you are afraid of the "death grip" issue (read above), wait until a permanent solution is found, but going straight to a 3GS would be a mistake.Some of you might not like the fact that Flash is unsupported, or that the App Store is too restrictive, but the good news is that you have plenty of choices out there, especially with Android and outside of AT&T's network"
"The EVO 4G, the Droid Incredible or the Droid X are all very capable alternatives.I hope that my experience with the iPhone 4 will help you figure out what yours would be"
"If there's an aspect of the phone that I have not covered or if you want to express an opinion or share your experience with others, please leave a comment below"
"If you like this review, share it with others, and thanks for tuning in!We got our iPhone 4 just over a week ago"
"To be honest, when it arrived, it was somewhat of a "meh" moment"
"Despite the brand-new form factor, it felt like just another updated version of the iPhone"
"Honestly, this should have been the iPhone 3GS; in our opinion, Apple's once-a-year update cycle is not aggressive enough"
"Initial reactions aside, after using it for two days, the iPhone 4.0 really grew on us to the point where we didn't want to go back to our 3GS"
"For starters, the increased screen resolution and performance in daylight is too good to ignore"
"Compared to other smart phone screens, everything is so much crisper on the iPhone 4"
"Battery life not only met, but exceeded our expectations"
"This thing keeps going and going"
"In our test, only constant use of GPS navigation programs will kill the battery quickly -- so if you're using the i4 to replace your TomTom or Garvin unit, don't forget the car charger"
"When the iPhone 3GS came out, the speed difference compared to prior iPhone models was noticeable"
"Based on the additional speed gain, the iPhone 4.0 should have been called "4GSS.""
"In fact, we've complained in the past that we are tired of mashing the home button as the primary way to navigate iOS (we love multiple buttons on Android phones), but thanks to the speed of the iPhone 4, you start to love the efficiency of using just one button for a lot of functions"
"As part of our review, we have noticed a significant upload speed boost on 3G and Wi-Fi"
"We have run Internet speed tests side by side with the HTC EVO 4G, and the iPhone was beating the EVO in upload test speeds -- and coming damn close to matching 4G speeds"
"We like the look of new phone; the glass on both sides and stainless steel band all around makes it look like a luxury item"
"But aesthetics and ergonomics are two different animals -- and honestly, we don't like the way the i4 feels in your hand"
"The weight of the phone feels great, but palming it to make a call, you notice how uncomfortable the square edges are"
"After using it for a week, that uncomfortable feeling didn't go away"
"We usually don't try to be one of the first to post reviews of new iPhone models (or other phones for that matter)"
"We prefer to use them for a while first, so we can develop a fully-formed opinion and tell our users about all the cons as well as the pros"
"Fanboyism is great -- but we're here to help our readers, and reviews are part of that help"
"Let's get to the most important part of our review: how did the new iPhone performed as a PHONE"
"By now you're probably aware of the so-called "death grip" problem (if not, see here and here and here for an update)"
"In short: if you hold your iPhone 4.0 certain way -- i.e"
"connect two antennas with your hand on the left side of the phone -- that will cause antenna attenuation, with a signal strength drop of up to 24dB"
"Now, we can go into a long tirade how our iPhone performed well in most situations, phone calls were clear, and that we usually got great internet speeds"
"But the bottom line is, the "death grip" DOES causes antenna attenuation, which results in dropped calls and lost internet connections, and was a noticeable problem during our review"
"To be fair, our tests and failures are more anecdotal then empirical, but other people performed empirical tests which support our observations – and, more importantly, the observations of the thousands of people who reported the attenuation issue"
"Up to this point, the response from Apple on the issue has been less than stellar, either blaming users for holding their iPhones wrong, claiming that signal attenuation is part of any phone, or shrugging “oops, our signal strength algorithm is wrong.?"
"Unfortunately, none of those responses are comforting in the slightest"
"It boils down to the following: in the past few days, we’ve been asked by our friends/family/colleagues if we would recommend that they get the iPhone 4"
"We can get into a whole discussion – or just say “It depends? – but that would be waste of time, not to mention a disservice to people who trust our judgment"
"Our answer is:"
"Wait"
"Do not get an iPhone 4 until we know more about the reception issues"
"The logic here is simple: it’s the “Version 1.0 syndrome.?"
"Being an early adapter of any gadget comes with an understanding that issues WILL pop up, and you WILL have to deal with them"
"We do not want our friends, family, colleagues and readers to have to deal with those issues"
"At the end of the day, we will be a front line for answering questions and supporting the issues -- not Apple"
"In our opinion, and based on our experience, the iPhone 4 reception problem is a big deal"
"Right now, the iPhone 4 can be considered “bleeding-edge technology.?"
"Do you REALLY want your phone to bleed all over you"
"We didn’t think so.The iPhone 4 is no small thing to review"
"As most readers of Engadget are well aware, in the gadget world a new piece of Apple hardware is a major event, preceded by rumors, speculation, an over-the-top announcement, and finally days, weeks, or months of anticipation from an ever-widening fan base"
"The iPhone 4 is certainly no exception -- in fact, it may be Apple's most successful launch yet, despite some bumps on the road"
"We've already seen Apple and AT&T's servers overloaded on the first day of pre-orders, the ship date for the next set of phones pushed back due to high demand, and die-hard fans in line outside of Apple locations a week before the phone is actually available"
"It's a lot to live up to, and the iPhone 4 is doing its best -- with features like a super-fast A4 CPU, a new front-facing camera and five megapixel shooter on the back, a completely new industrial design, and that outrageous Retina Display, no one would argue that Apple has been asleep at the wheel"
"So the question turns to whether or not the iPhone 4 can live up to the intense hype"
"Can it deliver on the promises Steve Jobs made at WWDC, and can it cement Apple's position in the marketplace in the face of mounting competition from the likes of Google and Microsoft"
"We have the answers to those questions -- and many more -- in our full review, so read on to find out!iPhone 4 review hands-onHardwarePerhaps the most notable change with the new iPhone is the drastic industrial design overhaul -- Apple seems to have completely rethought its strategy on how the phone should look and feel, and the results are nothing if not striking.Industrial designIn his WWDC keynote, Steve Jobs likened the design of the iPhone 4 to that of a "beautiful, old Leica camera," and as we've said before, he wasn't off the mark"
"Instead of hewing to the curved, plasticky, silver-bezeled look of the iPhone 3G and 3GS, the company has turned the casing and face of the device into something decidedly more detailed and sophisticated"
"From the design aesthetic through to the actual build process, Jony Ive and his team have reset what we expect in an iPhone, coming up with something that clearly harkens back to the retro-future Braun designs of Dieter Rams"
"The iPhone 4 is made up of three basic parts: two pieces of smooth, strengthened glass, and a stainless steel band which wraps around the sides, top, and bottom of the phone"
"The effect is clean but not simple, and Apple has added little details, like altered volume buttons (what used to be a rocker is now separated into circular clickers labeled + and -), and notches in that metal band which serve to improve radio connections (more on that in a minute)"
"The phone is noticeably thinner than the 3GS at .37 inches compared to .48 inches, but it weighs the same 4.8 ounces, making the whole package seem tighter and denser"
"It feels great in your hand, with good heft, although it might take a little time to get used to the lack of a rounded back if you're coming from the 3G or 3GS.We can't overstate how high-end the design of the iPhone 4 is"
"The 3GS now feels cheap and chubby by comparison, and even a phone like the HTC Droid Incredible -- which just came out -- seems last-generation.As we said, there are three main pieces of the phone, which together create an effect not wildly dissimilar to that of an ice cream sandwich"
"You know, but far pricier.."
"and not edible"
"The face of the device is made up of extremely strong glass which Jony Ive says is "comparable in strength to sapphire crystal, but about 30 times harder than plastic." A small slit for the earpiece and the front-facing camera are embedded in the glass above the display, with the familiar home button towards the bottom -- a button we should note feels much clickier than on our 3GS"
"On the left side of the phone you've got the new volume buttons, a redesigned mute switch, and a small notch towards the base of the unit"
"On the right side is the Micro SIM slot and another notch in the band at the bottom, and up top there's the power / sleep button, headphone jack, another notch, and new noise-canceling microphone"
"Along the bottom is a speaker, microphone, and the 30-pin dock connector port"
"The backside of the phone is made from the same kind of ultra-strong glass as the front, interrupted only by the new five megapixel camera, its LED flash companion and, of course, the Apple logo.Overall, the iPhone 4 outclasses pretty much every smartphone on the market in terms of industrial design"
"It just comes off like a far more expensive device, like a Mobiado or Vertu -- but better designed"
"And it's not just the way the phone looks; the materials feel good -- premium -- in your hands"
"The first few days we had our test unit, we were definitely freaked out about dropping or losing the phone, and some of that had to do with the fact that it's just a really beautiful device to use and hold.InternalsIt's not just the face of the phone that's undergone a transformation -- the iPhone 4 is all new inside as well"
"For starters, Apple has moved on from the Samsung-built ARM Cortex-A8-based CPU used in the 3GS to its custom A4 chip used in the iPad, which funnily enough.."
"is an ARM Cortex-A8-based CPU"
"While the company hasn't yet said what the clock speed of the processor is, we're guessing it's something below the 1GHz touted for its tablet cousin"
"The phone is definitely snappier than the 3GS, so we're not about to volley complaints just yet -- in particular, graphics seemed to render faster, and overall responsiveness was slightly higher, though admittedly, it wasn't blowing the doors off the joint"
"It's certainly faster, but the 3GS wasn't hurting on speed to our eyes, so it's not as wildly noticeable a leap as the 3G to the 3GS.As usual, Apple isn't fessing up about the RAM situation, though we have on very good authority that the iPhone 4 has 512MB onboard, a big step up from the 256MB in the previous model and the iPad"
"We would have liked to see it futureproofed with something like 1GB, but then again, Apple's got to sell a new phone in a year"
"As far as internal storage goes, you can buy the new iPhone in either 16GB ($199 on contract) or 32GB ($299 on contract) capacity -- fine for now, but since the company has just introduced 30FPS 720p video recording, you could find yourself outgrowing that number pretty quickly"
"It's a little odd, in fact, that the company didn't double down here and bump the capacity to 64GB, as it's recently done with the iPod touch"
"In terms of wireless, the iPhone 4 is packed with an 802.11n WiFi radio, as well as a quad-band HSUPA chip and Bluetooth 2.1.The redesigned housing allows for a much larger lithium-ion battery on the inside, providing improved numbers for Apple's life ratings (more on that in a moment), though it's still not easily replaceable"
"Additionally, the new phone has those two new cameras (VGA up front, five megapixels with LED flash around back), a new second microphone used to combat background noise while on calls (similar to the Nexus One), a gyroscope in addition to the standard accelerometer, a light sensor, and a proximity sensor"
"As with the 3GS, an AGPS chip and compass are bundled somewhere in that tiny frame as well.Of course, the big internal story is what has become external: namely, the UMTS, GPS, WiFi, and Bluetooth antennas"
"Apple has made the stainless band around the phone essentially a couple of big antennae, and they seem to be doing a pretty good job at hanging onto radio signals"
"The big question is obviously whether or not this fixes or helps with the constant dropped calls iPhone users on AT&T's network have gotten used to"
"Well in our testing, we had far, far fewer dropped calls than we experienced on our 3GS"
"Let's just say that again: yes, the iPhone 4 does seem to alleviate the dropped call issue"
"It wasn't perfect, and we had some connection issues in downtown New York City in particular, though it's tough to say if it was the fault of our phone, the cluster of buildings we were near, or the person we were speaking to, who was on a 3GS in the same location.DisplayBy now you should know that iPhone 4 has an all-new display, as well"
"Apple is calling the LED backlit, 960 x 640 IPS screen the "Retina Display" due to its high resolution and pixel density"
"At the same 3.5-inches as the older screens, the new display manages an insane 326ppi pixel density along with an 800:1 contrast ratio"
"Steve made a huge point about the science behind this technology during his keynote, claiming that the resolution of the screen essentially tops what is perceivable by the human eye"
"There have been some debates as to whether or not this argument holds water, but we can tell you this: to our eyes, there has never been a more detailed, clear, or viewable screen on any mobile device"
"iPhone 3GS on the left, iPhone 4 on the rightNot only are the colors and blacks deep and rich, but you simply cannot see pixels on the screen"
"Okay, if you take some macro camera shots or get right up in there you can make them out, but in general use, the screen is free of jaggies of any type, unless you're looking at a last-gen app that hasn't had its artwork updated"
"Text rendering is incredibly clear and clean -- webpages that would be line after line of pixelated content when zoomed out on a 3GS (say, Engadget or the New York Times) are completely readable on the iPhone 4, though the text is beyond microscopic"
"It's impressive, and doubly impressive when you look at higher-res graphics or watch 720p video on the phone -- the detail in moving images is particularly striking"
"What's nice is that most apps with text in them will benefit from this tech whether or not they've been updated, as long as they're using Apple's font rendering"
"Text in the Engadget app, for instance, looks cleaner, clearer, and much easier to read on the new iPhone.Nexus One up top, iPhone 4 belowBecause Apple is using IPS and LED technology for its screen, the iPhone 4 is mercifully visible in full sunlight, and performance in low light and at extreme viewing angles are favorable"
"Overall, you simply won't find a better display on a phone, and that's not just lip service.CamerasThe cameras on the new iPhone are going to be a topic of much debate, since this has been an area where Apple has been slow to innovate"
"The 3GS sported a measly three megapixel shooter with few bells and whistles (and no flash), and while it was fine for quick snaps, it wasn't an artist's tool by any means"
"The company finally seems to be listening to a public that's interested in leaving the point-and-shoot at home in favor of a phone with a capable camera, by adding a five megapixel shooter to the backside of the iPhone 4 and a VGA camera up front.Let's first take a look at the higher-res main camera"
"At his WWDC keynote, Jobs said that getting great looking images wasn't just about upping the camera's megapixels, but had more to do with grabbing more photons"
"Increase the photon count, let more light in, and your images will look better, the thought goes"
"So Apple's using a newer backside-illuminated sensor that's more sensitive to light in addition to upping those megapixels -- and we must say, pictures on the iPhone 4 look stunning"
"Our shots looked good right out of the gate, with few problems when it came to focusing or low light"
"With the flash on, we managed decent if somewhat blown out results (fairly common with smaller LED flashes) though impressively, the iPhone 4 was usually able to take completely useable and even handsome photos in fairly low light without the flash"
"It seems like that photon situation is definitely in play, because even shots taken in fairly dark lighting came out looking good"
"Autofocus worked well in most situations, and we were actually able to get some impressive looking macro shots (see the flowers and Penny below)"
"In general, we'd have no trouble using the iPhone 4's camera as a stand-in for a dedicated camera"
"Not only did it take beautiful shots, but the A4 and iOS 4 combo have considerably sped up the time it takes to snap pictures -- it's now almost instantaneous"
"Otherwise, you have options for a 5x digital zoom (which produces results that look like a digital zoom) and basic on / off / auto settings for the flash"
"It's pretty bare bones, and we wouldn't have minded a few basic options like white balance settings -- but c'mon, this is Apple we're talking about"
"Luckily, the App Store is chock full of applications that improve upon the stock camera app -- we expect to see a handful of new ones that take advantage of the new sensor soon.iPhone 4 camera shotsAs far as video goes, we were definitely impressed by the 720p capture, though there are stability issues with the lens and the all-too-familiar "jellyvision" CMOS issues that tend to rear their head if you're not holding the phone very steady"
"Still, we can't see carrying around a Flip HD instead of just keeping this in our pocket (though as we said, we'd like to see a higher storage capacity)"
"Everything we shot looked crisp and mostly artifact-free, and we didn't see any hiccups in the 30 FPS rate Apple claims, even in lower light"
"Adding iMovie to the mix for on-the-fly editing is a nice touch too (more on that in the software section)"
"The video below was shot and edited completely in-phone, so enjoy -- and here's the raw output to download.Around front, the VGA camera is.."
"well, a VGA camera"
"It actually does a fine job of capturing your face during video calls, and worked surprisingly well in low light, but it's not going to win any prizes for being the most advanced shooter on a handset"
"It does provide for some interesting angle options when it comes to video shooting, and we expect a lot of people will be taking advantage of the weirdly video game-like perspective"
"All in all, it looks good, but it's pretty utilitarian.Speaker / earpieceWe've never had a particular problem with the speaker or earpiece on previous iPhones (well, the speakerphone has never been loud enough for our taste), but it's obvious that Apple has done some work on getting both call quality and speakerphone quality up"
"Beyond making the phone considerably and consistently louder in both places, the clarity of the iPhone 4 is noticeably improved from the previous generation"
"If you read our review, then you know that we thought Motorola's original Droid had some of the best sounding components we've heard on a phone, and the new iPhone definitely gives them a run for the money"
"The first time we took a call on the device we were walking down New York's extremely noisy Fifth Avenue, and right away it was obvious that the secondary, noise-canceling mic was doing some heavy lifting, at least on the other end of the line"
"Even though sirens were wailing behind us and we were surrounded by chatty shoppers, it was easy to hear our party on the other end, and they could hear us perfectly (unless we were lied to)"
"There's clearly a difference between the sound in the earpiece on the new phone versus the 3GS, and it ranks highly against newer competition like the EVO"
"As far as the speakerphone goes, it gets loud without distorting or producing cutting midrange, a problem we've noticed on quite a few recent phones"
"We'd liken the iPhone 4 in quality to something along the lines of the BlackBerry Bold -- a bearable tone even when it gets hot.SoftwareAs with the other revisions to Apple's phone line, the hardware is only half of the story"
"Along with the iPhone 4 comes iOS 4, the re-branded iPhone OS which boasts loads of new features, most notably a very Apple-ized version of smartphone multitasking, a video calling feature dubbed FaceTime, folders so you can organize your apps, enhanced Mail, and lots of other nips and tucks -- both big and small -- that refine the company's growing operating system"
"Additionally, Apple has ported the iPad's iBooks to the smaller screen, and has created a new version of its popular iMovie just for the iPhone 4"
"Overall, the OS is still very much the same as it's always been, but there are some big changes here that bear investigation.MultitaskingThis is a big one, and more than just a little controversial"
"Since the dawn of apps for the iPhone (remember, way back in 2008?), people have been up in arms about the lack of third-party backgrounding for applications"
"Sure, you could keep Mail, Safari, iPod, and a few other Apple programs cranking while you used your phone, but those privileges were strictly off limits for third-party devs working on the device"
"It's arguable that one of the driving forces behind the jailbreaking movement was a desire for this feature -- something a phone as powerful as the iPhone was clearly capable of"
"Apple's argument has always been that multitasking causes an undue amount of battery drain from phones, and had to be approached with caution, lest we all end up with juiceless phones at high noon"
"Recently, however, that tune has changed"
"Apple has -- in true Apple fashion -- "figured out" how to "do multitasking right" -- namely, the company isn't allowing full backgrounding as much as it's allowing a handful of APIs that mimic backgrounding"
"Things like holding onto a GPS signal, letting music play in the background, staying connected to VoIP calls (or receiving them), and fast switching (basically a way for you to return quickly to exactly where you left off in an app).So, does Apple pull it off"
"Can this scarce handful of APIs makeup for true backgrounding"
"In a word: yep.Here's the thing -- this may not be "true" multitasking for a lot of us, but it amounts to multitasking for most of us"
"That is, it looks, feels, and acts like multitasking, so it's pretty tough to complain about it"
"In fact: we're not going to complain about it, especially given the fact that some of our favorite apps -- the IRC client Colloquy being one of them -- do just about exactly what we need them to do, all according to Apple's rules and regulations"
"Previous to the new OS, we'd been jailbreaking our phone just to keep an IRC session running in the background"
"Now, utilizing some of those new APIs, the Colloquy developers have created an elegant and useful solution that pleases both users and the Cupertino Cops"
"The point is: it works, it does so bug free, and without a major drain on battery life (quite the contrary.."
"more on that in a moment)"
"We're not saying we liked waiting for this kind of thing to come around, and yes, we'd prefer something more open and flexible -- but this works, and works well.So how is Apple making this magic happen"
"Here's a breakdown of just exactly what multitasking really means (and feels like) on the new iPhone (and the 3GS):Fast app switching: You know how you can leave off in Mail halfway through writing a response and go back to exactly where you were"
"Well that happens everywhere now"
"When you leave the app, you go back in exactly the same place"
"And it happens quickly"
"Fast app switching is essentially like toggling between "paused" applications"
"This combined with Apple's new app switcher (double tap the home button to bring up your most recently used apps) destroys that annoying iPhone feeling of going in and out and in and out"
"It just doesn't exist anymore, provided all your apps are up to date, which is going to take some time"
"It's amazing how much this single feature counts -- it's definitely one of the prime movers here, and it's so simple it's stupid"
"We would have liked to see options for "favorite" apps or some way to prioritize what you're switching to, but once you get used to this system -- which just puts whatever you've used most recently to the far left -- it makes some sense.Task completion: Basically, task completion lets an app do its thing even if you leave it"
"So if you're uploading or downloading a picture in Evernote or Dropbox, or saving an article in the New York Times app, even if you navigate away, the job is done when you get back to the app"
"This accounts for a lot of what we think of as multitasking"
"Most of your apps are just idling -- it's only when you interact with them that it counts"
"We don't know the boundaries for this API, though it seems to leave a lot of room for creative use"
"We know it's not just big jobs, it's little ones too -- Colloquy uses this feature to keep you connected to your IRC host"
"To be honest, that kind of behavior is one thing we thought we wouldn't see in iOS 4, and here it is"
"Hopefully Twitter app devs and other instant messaging clients will utilize the API in a similar manner.Background audio and VoIP: These two are straightforward"
"The first allows for music playing apps to keep their stream running in the background (and even gives them little widget controls in the app switcher), and the second allows VoIP connections to stay active"
"That means you can stay on a Skype call and go check your mail, but it also means that the VoIP connection will be aware of incoming calls when you're not actively using an app"
"Additionally, this API can be used to allow for recording even if you exit an app, as demonstrated effectively in the new version of Evernote.Background GPS: Basically, GPS apps can keep running in the background.."
"for obvious reasons"
"This one will drain your battery if you're not docked -- but who's using a GPS app and not plugging that thing in"
"Okay, we might be a little guilty of that"
"Regardless, this will keep your navigation software afloat if you have to take a call, and apparently will let GPS-centric apps like FourSquare check in even if you're not running it in the foreground.Apple combines these heavy hitters with more familiar tricks, like push notifications, to excellent effect"
"We know that the hardcore users will cry foul because a lot of this doesn't amount to "true" multitasking, but we also know that often solutions to problems come in different colors"
"Apple found a way in iOS 4 to solve a pretty good amount of its major problems in this department, and so far what we've seen is very promising"
"If it's only going to get better from here, we don't mind coming along for the ride"
"But it better only get better, Apple.FaceTimeIf you didn't know anything about video calling, Apple would definitely have you convinced that they just up and invented the concept based on never-aired Jetsons footage judged too futuristic for TV"
"Of course, the truth is that in lots of other places (and even in the US to an extent), smartphone video calling isn't exactly a new thing"
"In fact, in much of Europe and Asia, this technology is old hat"
"But Apple isn't going to let a little thing like facts get in the way of a good marketing play, and in their (slight) defense, no one's effectively brought video calling to the masses just yet"
"(One of our European editors says that he's gone ten years without seeing anyone make a video call in his neck of the woods.) While this may be an unscientific perspective, it suggests that it's not enough to just have the tech -- the feature needs to be sold to people.So has Apple done it"
"Maybe, and maybe not"
"We're certainly impressed by the concept and Apple's willingness to open up their "FaceTime standard" to anyone who wants to get in on the party"
"That means that developers on any platform -- provided they can meet all the necessary requirements -- can create applications that talk via the protocol (or set of protocols, really)"
"We're also impressed with the tech itself, which feels polished and slick out of the gate"
"But right now, there's only one way to do FaceTime calls, and that's via the iPhone 4.."
"and only over WiFi, which means that the opportunity to make these calls is pretty limited for now"
"Additionally, in our testing, we found that you really need to have a good, strong, nearby WiFi signal to hang onto a connection"
"More than once we had video freeze on us, and we had one fully dropped call because someone went out of the WiFi range, but hey.."
"you need to be in range for even the most basic tasks, so we can't fault Apple too much for that"
"It does seem clear that the iPhone video chats are moving quite a few bits around, however"
"What's nice about FaceTime is that unlike Qik or other third-party options for something like the EVO, there's no setup here and it's completely integrated into the dialer of the phone -- meaning the only hangup is whether or not you have decent WiFi.But what is it like"
"Well in truth, it's actually a teensy bit amazing"
"Yes, we're a little numb to the PR speak about how game changing it is, but there's still something deeply sci-fi about dialing up a friend and being able to hold this thing in your hand and have a video chat"
"We did a call with Apple's Greg Joswiak while he was in Paris (see the image above), and when he walked outside and flipped the camera to show us the Eiffel Tower, it was a legitimately weird experience -- a "you are there" moment"
"As you can see in the call below with USA Today's Ed Baig (his take on the iPhone 4 is right here), it's a pretty new way to talk to someone, at least for us"
"Having a random face-to-face conversation with a kid about what he's having for lunch is just the tip of the iceberg -- we can definitely see this feature coming into play in all sorts of ways in our lives.Technically speaking, actually making calls is straightforward; you can switch to a FaceTime chat while you're already connected, or you're given to option to launch right into a FaceTime connection"
"We were a little surprised by the fact that you can only mute the audio on your calls; if you want the video off, you need to cover the lens in the old fashioned way -- with your hands.All said, it's a fascinating inclusion, and we've got a sneaking suspicion that Apple intends to do more than just basic calls with this"
"Obviously the addition of conference FaceTime sessions would be huge, and we're also looking forward to using the function on a 3G network -- it's nice to have a chat from your house, but what would really be great is taking these kinds of conversations out into the wide world"
"We think that coupled with active development for clients on lots of platforms (not just the iPhone) will make FaceTime much more interesting -- it's a curiosity right now, but it could be something else entirely with a little time and elbow grease.FoldersWhat can you really say about folders"
"Basically: it's about time"
"We're happy that Apple has seen the light and included something like this in iOS 4, and the implementation is elegant enough, but it would have been nice to store more than 12 items at a time"
"As it stands, if you have a lot of one kind of app, you're going to end up with a group of folders in the same category"
"We have a second "Games" folder, but some of you out there will have more like six or seven of those"
"That helps the problem, but doesn't solve it completely"
"We get why Apple made this decision -- likely a desire to keep it simple -- but it would be nice to be able to make the room if you wanted it.Mail improvementsFor a lot of us, the new tweaks to the iPhone's Mail app have seriously been a long time coming"
"Among the major improvements in iOS 4 are a unified inbox and threaded messaging (finally!) -- both of which have made dealing with email on the iPhone a considerably more enjoyable experience"
"We still think that the mail client is lacking in comparison to Gmail, but that has more to do with our addiction to Gmail than anything else, we suspect"
"Overall, Mail feels much more complete now, and Apple has solved the same problem in Mail that it had with app switching -- that feeling of constantly jumping into and out of your inboxes.iBooks / iMovieThis isn't a barnstormer, but it's a nice inclusion"
"If you've used iBooks for the iPad, the experience is about the same.."
"just smaller"
"There's not a ton to say about it, except that in addition to lots of other great book apps on the iPhone, Apple has now given you its own"
"We still don't think it stacks up to Amazon or Barnes & Noble in terms of selection, though the presentation is better in many ways, and it will sync your notes and bookmarks across platforms.iMovie, on the other hand, is something new entirely"
"We can't say we didn't see this one coming since Apple just added video recording and editing to its arsenal with the introduction of iPhone OS 3 and the 3GS -- but this takes things one step further"
"The $4.99 app gives you access to more advanced features, like a (very) limited selection of transitions between clips, the option to add audio to your videos, plus a handful of themes and titling effects"
"We found it to be extremely capable for fast edits, though everything is pretty sandboxed here, so while you do have the most basic editing tools, things like splitting a clip can be a little bit of a hassle"
"Since you can only edit the beginning and end of a snippet, if you want to split something into multiple parts you have to drag the clip into your edit repeatedly and then scale the start and finish points for each one"
"It can be a pain if you're doing lots of jump cuts -- though we don't expect everyone to be making the next Casino on this thing.."
"though, someone probably will, right"
"For a few bucks, it's definitely worth having, and we expect that after a few people start using the thing, Apple might be prompted to add a few more options.What's not in the new OSIt's not all wine and roses as far as we're concerned"
"While Apple has made huge strides in many areas here, this wouldn't be an Engadget review if we didn't have our nitpicks"
"In particular, we still cannot understand or accept the company's approach to notifications"
"We're at version 4 of this OS, and we're still plagued by these intrusive, productivity-freezing alerts"
"If you're as busy as we are, then you know what it's like to get invite after invite for your calendar, text messages, and push notifications that just stall the phone out"
"While every other modern OS-maker has figured out an elegant way to deal with notifications (including the forthcoming Windows Phone 7), Apple clings to this broken system"
"Why"
"We can't really say"
"We find it hard to believe that there aren't folks in Cupertino who feel the way we do -- in fact, we're sure of it"
"Maybe that explains the hiring of Palm's "notification guru" Rich Dellinger"
"We sure hope!The other thing that's driving us crazy is the lack of widgets"
"Apple almost gets there with its new extensible music player controls, but there are still no good solutions for glanceable information on the iPhone"
"We'll admit that it's better now that fast app switching is in play, but we'd still like that weather icon to actually show us the temperature where we live"
"Is that too much to ask"
"The competition seems to have this one licked -- we'd really like to see Apple take a stab at it.AccessoriesIt wouldn't be a new iPhone without some accessories, but Apple has kept it tidy"
"The company is offering a new dock, of course, for twenty-nine of your US dollars (that's $29), and a selection of colorful "bumpers" that protect the phone for the same price"
"We've got a few bumpers in-house, and while we're not really big fans of the way they look or feel, they do seem to protect the phone pretty well"
"On that note, we've actually seen the iPhone 4 tossed with and without a bumper across a room (one hit a wall) with no issue, and we dropped ours pretty hard from about two feet up onto tile with nary a scratch.Battery lifeThis is a big one for many people, and we have some fairly surprising news to report"
"The battery life on the iPhone 4 has been outstanding thus far, exceeding our expectations for longevity during testing"
"We've only had a short time to use the phone, but in the week or so we've been carrying the device as our main phone, we've had pretty amazing results under normal to heavy use"
"In fact, we managed to squeeze more than 38 hours -- yes, 38 hours -- of life out of a single charge using the phone as we normally would"
"We're talking calls, some gaming, lots of push email and calendar invites, playing music over Bluetooth in the car, and just general testing (like downloading new apps, rearranging icons, tweaking settings)"
"We went from 10:30AM on a Saturday morning till 1:00AM on Monday without needing to charge the phone"
"Of course, it switched itself off just after the clock struck 1, but it was thrilling -- like that episode of Seinfeld where Kramer and the car salesman see how far they can get in a car with the tank on E"
"Sitcom references aside, the battery life seems markedly improved in the iPhone 4, and why not"
"It's got a much larger battery coupled with that iPad-powering A4, which has already shown that it can sip rather than gulp power.Once the rest of the team has their iPhones in hand, we'll do some hardcore battery life testing and see what we come up with, but we think under pretty active use, the iPhone 4 blows Apple's previous generation phone out of the water, and makes a lot of the competition look downright needy.Wrap-upWe're not going to beat around the bush -- in our approximation, the iPhone 4 is the best smartphone on the market right now"
"The combination of gorgeous new hardware, that amazing display, upgraded cameras, and major improvements to the operating system make this an extremely formidable package"
"Yes, there are still pain points that we want to see Apple fix, and yes, there are some amazing alternatives to the iPhone 4 out there"
"But when it comes to the total package -- fit and finish in both software and hardware, performance, app selection, and all of the little details that make a device like this what it is -- we think it's the cream of the current crop"
"We won't argue that a lot of this is a matter of taste -- some people will just prefer the way Android or Symbian works to the iPhone, and others will be on the lookout for a hardware keyboard or a particular asset that the iPhone 4 lacks -- but in terms of the total picture, it's tough to deny that Apple has moved one step past the competition with this phone"
"Of course, in the hyper-accelerated smartphone market where the Next Big Thing seems to always be just around the corner, it's anyone's guess how long they keep that edge.iPhone 4 Overview It's good to be the king"
"Or at least it was"
"Until the rest of the land began forming their own castles and employing their own hierarchical structures and empowering their own citizens"
"Yes, the iPhone 4 is a dazzling new device that sits in a faded throne"
"Rather than feel an ever-present sense of complacence, the iPhone 4 has to stand guard day and night"
"Samsung's Galaxy S phones, HTC's Droid Incredible and EVO, Motorola's Droid X and Droid 2 and Blackberry's Bold 9800 are encroaching and threatening to usurp the smartphone crown"
"Have no fear, for the iPhone 4 offers some essential and shiny upgrades like its Retina display, 5-megapixel camera with 720p, FaceTime Web chat, and bolstered processing guts"
"But with so many other advanced smartphone kingdoms forming over the neighboring hills, the iPhone 4's upgrades can only solidify its place as one of the premiere entertainment smartphones rather than a business powerhouse as well"
"Let's let down the drawbridge and head inside the castle"
"iPhone 4 Design and Retina Display Apple is touting the iPhone 4 as the world's thinnest smartphone, measuring in at 9.3mm thick, but it's also heavier than we expected"
"The Samsung Captivate felt like a feather next to the iPhone 4, but Apple makes up for its weight in the quality department"
"Remember that cheap plastic back on the iPhone 3G that was prone to scratching"
"How about the plastic Silent Mode tab that suddenly snapped off a few months down the road"
"Well, the iPhone 4's body construction is fused together by a solid stainless steel band that also integrates antennas"
"For the record, we never experienced any antenna issues"
"Along this band resides a structurally sound metal Silent Mode tab with two round volume control buttons, independent of one another for better control"
"On top we have the Lock/Power button and an accompanying 3.5mm audio jack"
"The Apple iPhone 4 is equipped with a speaker and a microphone for FaceTime chats, both of which are located along the bottom of the phone"
"The SIM card slot is concealed nicely along the right side of the phone while the front and back panels of the iPhone 4 ooze with glossy swank"
"The panels are composed of the same aluminosilicate glass used in helicopter and high-speed train windshields, so they can withstand a fairly hefty dosage of gravitational force, as in skydiving"
"We think the Apple iPhone 4 is without a doubt the sexiest smartphone on the market, and its Retina display just adds more fuel to the fire"
"The iPhone's 3.5-inch screen is not as impressive when compared to the Samsung Captivate's 4-inch screen, but its 960 x 640-pixel resolution makes up for the short staffing in the dimensions department"
"The iPhone 4's screen cranks out 326 pixels per square inch, and we struggled to find any visible pixels"
"They're just too small"
"While the Captivate's screen technology was top-notch in many scenarios, the Apple iPhone 4's Retina display experience was overall the most realistic and lifelike display we've ever encountered in the smartphone world, and needs to be experienced to be believed"
"iPhone 4 iOS 4 Experience Apple has renamed the traditional iPhone OS to iOS, which is geared to work across the full spectrum of Apple products including the iPod and iPad"
"That also means synchronization across all Apple products, so if you download an eBook or game on the iPad, you can sync it to your phone, and vice versa"
"As far as email, we get Exchange support, as well as IMAP and POP3"
"We could also check all of our mail via a unified inbox that showed multiple accounts in the same stream"
"Multitasking for select types of functionality is also part of the deal"
"With an Apple A4 processor and 512MB of RAM, the iPhone 4 flies through operations and handles multiple tasks at once"
"What happens is that the iPhone 4 ironically gets a limited version of a feature Windows Mobile has had for nearly a decade, where it'll freeze an application or program, keeping it in a background cache for future use"
"We were able to rifle between applications thanks to the bottom Application bar that can be accessed from anywhere by tapping the Home button"
"We could also listen to music in the background while performing various tasks like web browsing or playing games, thanks to third-party applications like Pandora"
"GPS can be kept running while performing other tasks and Skype or VoIP calls can be answered while doing other things"
"We were very impressed with Apple's iOS experience"
"It's highly intuitive and takes the previous version of the OS to a new level of productivity and efficiency"
"However, we're still married to the proprietary world of Apple-branded features"
"For instance, there was no way to set a custom Ringtone or Notification tone unless we dropped some cash or went the jailbreak route"
"On for instance the Samsung Captivate, we could just drag and drop any sound we wanted onto the microSD card and assign numerous different sounds to different actions"
"Hopefully Apple will do something about this in the future"
"Check out iPhone 4 specifications"
"iPhone 4 FaceTime Let's talk about the Apple iPhone 4's camera configuration"
"We've got a 5-megapixel CMOS shooter in the back and a 1.3-megapixel VGA cam in the front for FaceTime chats and self-portraits"
"The camera on the back has an LED flash that functions as a video light while recording 720p video or any other quality"
"We get down and dirty with the cameras a few sections down, so we're going to focus mainly on FaceTime, which is Apple's version of in-phone Web chat via Wi-Fi"
"We used FaceTime and were satisfied with how clear the subject was and the refined motion"
"There was no frame lagging, and we could hold conversations clearly, thanks to the dual-mic noise suppression"
"Unlike a laptop, FaceTime also gave us the freedom to roam around the house, taking our FaceTime buddies with us"
"iPhone 4 Multimedia and Voice Quality We know that Netflix is heading Apple's way, which will open up the floodgates to downloadable content via wireless or 3G networks, and we still have Apple's omnipotent App Store for thousands of games, tools, and other miscellaneous applications"
"Speaking of gaming, the Apple iPhone 4 has a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer for improved game control"
"We loaded Need for Speed on the iPhone 4 and Rolling Thunder on the Samsung Captivate and iOS 4 proved to be better optimized for such a task than Android 2.1"
"We also enjoyed watching movies on the iPhone 4, despite not offering the latest and greatest display technology on the market"
"Now for voice quality, we tested the iPhone by calling the Samsung Captivate"
"Both phones are in the same arena, and it is a good one"
"Apple's dual-mic noise suppression led to a background-free talk experience, even by a busy road"
"We were impressed by the clarity and lack of static"
"And about the antenna issue, we never had an issue with the iPhone 4's antenna—in fact, reception was great"
"Still, it's worth noting that Apple will provide iPhone 4 buyers with a free case as of late July, which should alleviate this issue if appearing"
"Another one of Apple's claims centered around battery life—as always"
"Being packed with high-end technology in a compact body, what usually ends up happening is we see the same battery lifespan every round of new phones"
"iPhone 4 Still Image Quality The Apple iPhone 4's camera is one of its feature attractions"
"We've got a 5-megapixel 720p HD CMOS image sensor with 1.75-micron BSI pixel architecture geared to improve low-light sensitivity"
"We found the iPhone 4's camera to be pretty good, though we could discern a few tricks"
"First off, colors are vibrant, to the point of almost being neon at times, so saturation is undoubtedly pumped"
"There's also a lot of internal sharpening going on, giving us a defined image at the cost of boosted noise in low light"
"The saturation and vibrant color reproduction came to the iPhone 4's aid in low light, though certain images were pelted with black noise"
"However, the iPhone 4 could expose where many other popular phones couldn't"
"We also experienced an excellent handling of motion while shooting out of a moving car and the phone's LED flash provided a significant illumination boost"
"It's worth noting that the Camera mode is strictly stripped down to the ability to tap Focus"
"When you tap, you are essentially adjusting the Focus, Exposure, White Balance, and ISO, so it's more of an Auto/Manual hybrid tool"
"While the Samsung Captivate provides a wealth of filters, effects, manual controls, and shooting modes, the iPhone 4 relies on 3rd party Camera applications to get the job done"
"We would have liked a nice suite of manual controls to go with this nice sensor, but Apple's aim is simplicity, and for a camera that can point, tap, and shoot with great results nine out of ten times, the iPhone 4's camera is still great in terms of image quality"

"We're sure Apple has a plan for the future as far as Web services are concerned, and we're confident that iTunes and App Store will keep improving"

"It'll primarily be remembered as a year when Apple spent most of its resources getting up to speed on previous shortcomings"

"Every June since, there’s been a new model"
"Apple typically kept adding features like 3G, GPS, the ability to run third-party apps .."
"features that seemed thrilling and exotic within the context of the iPhone but which in the larger world of smartphones were about as unusual as nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere.But who cares"
"Each of these features made the iPhone materially better"
"And the true star of the iPhone experience was always the iPhone OS (now iOS 4), which I’m convinced remains head-and-shoulders the easiest, most attractive, and most meticulously-cultivated mobile OS out there.Another June has come, and we inevitably have another iPhone"
"As I run through the list of the iPhone 4’s new features, I am once again tempted to crank up my cynicism generator and note that most these items are features we’ve seen before on other phones: things like a high-definition display, an LED flash, a forward-facing camera and the ability to do video conferencing.If a quick glance at the iPhone 4’s new features inspires initial cynicism, spending five days immersed in the actual device makes another impression entirely"
"For the first time since 2007, I feel as though the device I’m carrying isn’t merely an improved iPhone, but a truly new one.iPhone 4 DesignI’m surprised by what often passes for mobile phone design these days"
"I flip a $200 phone in my hands in search of the Power button and it feels like a 1984 handheld electronic football game"
"It’s filled with odd angles and bumps, and I can feel loose seams where sections of the case don’t fit together properly.The iPhone 4 feels as though someone sat down, cracked his or her knuckles, and decided that they were going to design and construct the hell out of this thing.The iPhone 4 is a frame of stainless steel that contains the phone’s screen and electronics, sandwiched between two sheets of aluminosilicate glass, at the back and the front"
"The frame is interrupted sparingly and politely by the usual small assortment of iPhone function buttons, done up in brushed metal"
"At 9.3 millimeters thin, the iPhone is the thinnest smartphone on the market, according to Apple.Well, I can’t imagine a phone being any thinner without sacrificing function"
"I was concerned that the flat shape and hard edges would be uncomfortable to hold and operate"
"Not so; the iPhone 4 feels terrific in your hand"
"It has a positive and reassuring heft as you root it out of a jacket pocket"
"That kind of thing actually does matter.Another advantage of this design is that its thin profile and straight, simple lines make it more “case-able? than any other iPhone"
"In some ways, it seems like a “blank? phone"
"You can add protection to the iPhone without necessarily adding bulk and ugliness .."
"two factors which have historically led me to carry my various phones around as-is, naked and afraid.Apple has started the ball rolling with their own “bumper? cases: a rubberized collar (available in six colors) that snaps around the stainless-steel frame and offers a welcome measure of impact-protection.At $29, the bumper seems a bit pricey"
"But it isn’t just a thick rubber band: the iPhone’s power and volume buttons are covered by well-engineered mechanical pushers"
"Once it’s in place, the bumper looks like an integral part of the iPhone.I like what the bumper does to the iPhone 4"
"It adds practically no bulk to the phone and doesn’t mar its clean design at all"
"Meanwhile, its rubberized surface makes the iPhone much “grippier? and prevents it from sliding away from you on a marble tabletop when you make a clumsy reach for it.Which brings us to the subject of ...DurabilityThe iPhone 4 represents a radical new design"
"I’ve never seen a phone that even comes close to this.Which naturally invited me to wonder about how durable this design is"
"Once, while juggling car keys and packages, I dropped a Nexus One about 40 inches straight onto a marble floor"
"The dent and the scuff proved that it had landed right on a corner of the case"
"The impact had sent the battery and the battery cover flying but otherwise, the phone was completely undamaged.And that’s what I’ve come to expect from plastic cases"
"I trust them"
"All I know about stainless steel is that it transmits force instead of absorbing it; what I know about glass is that it fractures instead of patiently rippling.In my briefings with Apple, I was told a little bit about this aluminosilicate glass"
"It’s actually 30 times stronger than ordinary plastic and it’s even used in the windshields of military helicopters.Fab"
"But what happens to a military helicopter if it slips out of your coat pocket and drops onto your driveway as you’re getting out of the car"
"I’ve never done that to any of my own military helicopters, so I really have no idea.All of these things were on my mind as I unboxed the iPhone 4 and charged it up.Before I tell you what happened to this phone, I should point out that my brother tech columnist Walt Mossberg over at the Wall Street Journal dropped his prerelease iPhone 4 “several times from a few feet onto a hard surface with no problem.? Ed Baig over at USA Today said that “an Apple executive dropped it in front of me"
"The phone was undamaged.?BoingBoing “banged it on the side of metal tables? without incident.I mention all of this intentional abuse of Apple property for two reasons:First, to indicate that the iPhone 4 is indeed designed to be very tough, and in particular, that if Apple was willing drop one in front of a reviewer, then they must be pretty confident about the iPhone 4’s durability.And secondly, to make myself feel a little better about the fact that I accidentally dropped and broke Apple's loaner iPhone 4 about 10 hours after unboxing it (see the accompanying gallery).Yeah"
"I’m not proud about that"
"The back panel was thoroughly cracked up .."
"though the iPhone still worked fine.I was out with friends, it was after dinner, and I was idly playing with the iPhone 4 on top of the table the same way I idly play with my iPhone 3GS and my Nexus One"
"But for some reason, it skidded out of my reach and clattered onto the hard floor.It wasn’t in a bumper case"
"If it were, I probably couldn’t have fumbled it across the table and it might have had some protection when it hit the hard floor"
"I couldn’t tell if it had hit the metal table leg on the way down or had smacked into the floor cleanly"
"But the results were pretty impeccable.So: what have we learned, Charlie Brown?Actually, not very much"
"I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect any consumer phone to survive a drop from a table"
"As soon as a phone becomes airborne, it’s out of warranty and enters the realm of “Do you feel lucky today, punk??The experience did encourage me to spend a lot of time over the past five days investigating the durability of the iPhone 4"
"This YouTube video is typical of what I’ve been hearing and seeing:It’s a static drop test in which the iPhone 4 free-falls from what appears to be about forty inches, straight onto asphalt"
"It’s perfectly fine after the first drop"
"The guy in the video has to drop it four times to get the screen to break"
"It’s clear that he’s even trying to impart some spin after the first one.This, and conversations with other iPhone 4 users, has left me convinced that the iPhone 4 is (at the very least) no less durable than any other consumer smartphone, despite its radical new design"
"You don’t need to handle it with anything more than the usual amount of caution and care you’d use with any smartphone.I'm annoyed that the iPhone now has two crackable glass panels instead of one"
"But it appears that any drop that would break an iPhone 4 would have totaled an iPhone 3GS just as readily"
"The lesson remains: take care of your toys.That said: I’ll definitely be carrying my iPhone — and all of my phones — in cases from now on.I asked Apple if the Apple Stores offered a specific repair for a broken back panel.Obviously, it was carelessly-inflicted damage and shouldn’t be covered by warranty"
"But I’ve seen the iPhone 4 disassembled: it would appear that the back panel lifts straight off after the removal of two exposed screws.Apple referred me to the standard policy regarding out-of-warranty repairs: it’s a flat-rate fee of $199"
"I suspect that replacement rear panels will soon become popular items on fix-your-iPhone-yourself retail sites.Signal IssuesI noticed something odd with the iPhone from almost the moment I first powered it up: my cell signal was fluctuating"
"I normally get a strong five-bar signal in my office but sometimes it would slowly creep down to just one, and then back up again; other times I’d pick it up and there’d be no problem"
"Meanwhile, my iPhone 3GS showed a full signal.The iPhone’s stainless-steel frame isn’t just there for style and structure; it’s also the phone’s antenna assembly"
"The black seams between its steel sections represent gaps between the phone’s Bluetooth/WiFi/GPS antenna and the larger one that’s responsible for the connection to the cell network.If I bridge the gap between the two antennas at the bottom-left corner of the iPhone, it somehow interferes with the performance of the cell antenna"
"Press it into my palm, and the signal drops"
"Remove it, and the signal comes back.It was my first exposure to a problem I’d see described all over message boards over the coming days"
"Same symptoms, same problem.Apple’s formal statement regarding this problem is:“Gripping any mobile phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance, with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas"
"This is a fact of life for every wireless phone.?Which, frankly, is an odd response"
"Apple has a point regarding “cold spots? on most mobile phones"
"But I have three other phones here in the office and no matter how I hold them, I can’t reproduce the same sort of dramatic impact as I can create by simply bridging the gap at the base of the iPhone with the heel of my left hand.Furthermore, the problem simply doesn’t happen when the iPhone is wearing a case .."
"even Apple’s bumper case"
"So it’s definitely a physical “bridging? problem, not a “blocking? problem"
"It’s pretty clear that this is a problem unique to a phone that wears its antennas on the outside.Naturally, this problem has received a lot of play online"
"That’s a shame, because it only tells a fraction of the whole story"
"It’s not necessary to hold the iPhone 4 in a specific way to avoid the problem"
"Quite the opposite; in my experiments, I found that there was just one position in which the signal degrades ...and it’s not even how I normally hold a phone.Bottom line on this bit: be aware of the problem .."
"but overall, don’t worry about it.A Golden Age Of iPhone WirelessIt’s an unfair issue to dwell on because the iPhone 4’s wireless abilities represent some of the true superstar features of the device.Even on AT&T’s 3G network, this phone is an utter scorcher compared to the iPhone 3GS.After running the SpeedTest app on both an iPhone 4 and a 3GS eight times in the same location ten minutes apart and throwing out the highest and lowest test results, I discovered that the iPhone 4’s average download speed was 15 percent faster than the 3GS.Nice"
"But that’s not the big news:The iPhone 4 is 4.4 times faster than its predecessor when uploading"
"That’s a high enough increase that I insisted that the iPhone 4 submit to an immediate drug test.It’s due to the iPhone 4’s improved implementation of HSDPA (which arrived with last year’s iPhone 3GS) and its brand-new support for HSUPA"
"Yes, take a guess at what the “D? (download speed) and the “U? (upload speed) stand for in those respective acronyms"
"The upshot: the iPhone 4 can make better use of all of the improvements that AT&T has been making to its network, and it shows immediately.Raw speed aside, the iPhone 4 is noticeably better at acquiring and maintaining a cell signal than its predecessor"
"I carried both my 3GS and the iPhone 4 around every day"
"Every time I noticed fewer than the full five bars of reception on the 3GS, I checked the iPhone 4 .."
"and it always showed a stronger signal"
"I made a side-trip to a location known for its spotty AT&T coverage and my experience there also pointed to some serious improvements to the iPhone’s signal reception.And the hits keep coming"
"Thanks to an upgraded GPS chip, the iPhone 4 locks onto a GPS signal much more quickly than the 3GS"
"I also noticed greater accuracy"
"My location has a far lesser tendency to “drift? than it does on the 3GS, too"
"Which is a bit of a letdown because I was sort of enjoying looking down at my phone during my morning constitutional and seeing that a sudden leap 70 yards to the right and then back again within one second had increased my average walking speed to about 90 miles per hour.You can also expect far greater WiFi speeds in certain locations"
"The iPhone 3GS and most other phones on the market today only support 802.11b and g"
"The iPhone 4 adds the much-faster 802.11n standard to its gunbelt.And Now, Let’s Bring Out Your Headliner: Retina DisplayThe iPhone 4’s signature feature, the one that appears above the title on the movie poster, is the Retina Display.It’s not enough to simply say that the iPhone 4’s new display offers “higher resolution? than the iPhone 3GS"
"It contains four times the number of pixels in the same screen size, so, yes .."
"quite right.But that doesn’t quite cut it"
"The Droid X and the HTC Incredible and the Sprint HTC EVO are much higher resolution than the 3GS"
"You look at any of these three phones you think “Wow"
"That’s a super-high-resolution display!?Sometimes when you look at the iPhone 4’s screen, you don’t know what you’re looking at"
"The dots aren’t “barely perceptible? .."
"they’re imperceptible.That’s physics, son"
"You can argue with the man, but you can’t, I say, you can’t argue with the physics, courtesy of Discover Magazine, boy!Well, at any rate, you’ll hurt your eyes trying to see individual pixelsAnd the intense dot pitch (326 dpi on a 960x640 3.5? display) is only half the story"
"The phenomenal impact of the display owes at least as much to its 800:1 contrast ratio as to its resolution"
"It can display an enormous range of light and color values.In an optimal environment, looking at a photo — or even a paused frame from Pixar’s “Up? — is eerily like looking like a large film transparency on a light table .."
"an illusion that’s enhanced by the fact that the surface of the screen is laminated directly to the underside of the iPhone’s front glass"
"There’s hardly any gap between the pixels and the surface"
"I keep looking for faults and weaknesses in the image"
"I can only find them when I go into full-on Nitpick mode.As a comparison test, I displayed an image of Holstein cows on the iPhone 4 and the Droid X"
"The Droid has an excellent screen (854x480 at 4.3?), but the superiority of the iPhone’s display was clear"
"There’s a point at which the Droid screen gives up and says “Okay"
"Let’s just say that the rest of this dark blotch on this cow’s hide is solid black, all the way down.?The iPhone begs to differ: it wants to show you the texture of coarse, black hair on the side of the cow all the way through the shadow.What’s the real impact of this superior display"
"Does it truly enhance your day-to-day use of the phone?It depends on the kind of user you are"
"During the simple, dull process of tapping your way through application buttons and drilling down through hierarchical menus .."
"no, you won’t really appreciate the difference.But when you’re browsing the Web, you’ll do a lot less zooming in to read pages"
"When you read an ebook, the higher resolution and the higher contrast between the “print? and the “page? makes for a more comfortable reading experience.Obviously, watching movies and viewing pictures on the iPhone 4 is up on a whole separate level"
"In fact, during my camera tests of the iPhone 4 versus three other phones and a camera, I initially scored the Droid X and the other phones a little worse than they deserved"
"Only when I got home and dumped my pictures to my desktop display did I realize that the other phones’ cameras were significantly better than I’d thought .."
"particularly that of the Droid X"
"On the train ride home, I’d previewed my shots right on their devices"
"The Droid X’s screen wasn’t presenting its own photos with nearly the kind of care and fidelity that the iPhone’s was.Obviously, many games will get a profound upgraded experience thanks to this display"
"But even a simple app like aSmart HUD, my favorite dashboard-mount speedometer app for my iPhone, is reinvented on an iPhone"
"On the 3GS, the speed and compass and other onscreen indicators look like a computer-generated display"
"On the iPhone 4, they look like human-generated artwork"
"Once again, you get the “medium-format color slide? effect.All existing iPhone apps get higher definition text and standard UI elements “for free?; the iPhone’s OS automatically renders those things at 4x resolution"
"Only bitmapped artwork needs to be re-rendered by the developers to take advantage of the 326-dpi screen resolution.I Take That Back: The Camera Is The True HeadlinerThe upgraded display is one of the features that redefines the iPhone for me"
"The camera is the other.This will read as a backhanded compliment, but I’ll hold my nose and forge ahead anyway: the iPhone 4 is the first cameraphone that earns the honor of being thought of as “a real camera, with some limitations? as opposed to “a great cameraphone.?My mental attitude is different when I shoot with the iPhone 4 cam"
"I’m not thinking “Gee, I wish I’d brought my real camera .."
"but I guess this cameraphone is better than nothing.?When I’m shooting with the iPhone 4, my goal is to make real photos"
"And it’s an eminently attainable one.Apple made a very smart decision: they upgraded the iPhone 4’s camera to just 5 megapixels instead of 8, which is what you’ll get with all of the “hot? Android phones that are arriving in 2010"
"Those cameras are slapping down more pixels but are they creating better photos?Not according to my tests"
"I walked around with the iPhone 4, an iPhone 3GS, the Google Nexus One, and the Verizon Droid X, plus my Nikon P6000 point-and-shoot as a control"
"In nearly every shot, the iPhone 4 was the champ among the cameraphones.The iPhone 4 camera has a wide dynamic range and it performs superbly in low-light situations thanks to its backside illumination image sensor (it scatters less light than the frontside illumination sensors; waste not, want not)"
"The iPhone is perfectly happy to shoot in available light in most situations"
"Even in daylight, you see the benefits of the larger sensor pixels and the backside illumination"
"On the 8-megapixel Droid X, a clump of trees in the background is a spray of green static"
"On the iPhone 4, they have detail and vibrance.It also has a new (for the iPhone) LED illuminator, serving as a primary light source or a bit of fill light to nearby subjects.I love the iPhone 4’s camera"
"That said, it has two consistent and sometimes annoying foibles"
"First, when you give it a challenging scene in which the camera needs to either underexpose slightly and lose some shadow detail or overexpose and blow out a highlight, it’ll blow out a highlight nearly every time"
"But you can easily work around this problem, thanks to the iPhone’s simple “tap an area to set the exposure and focus zone? feature"
"If this were a real photo and not a “see how well the camera handles this? test, I’d just recompose the photo, and tap the area that was being overexposed"
"The Camera app would base its exposure settings on that hightlight.The bigger problem is the iPhone 4’s easily-bamboozled automatic white balance system.The camera appears to have great difficulty dealing with two competing light sources when they’re of different colors"
"It’s nothing that can’t be fixed with one mouse click in any desktop photo editor, but it’s still annoying .."
"particularly when it even messed up the white balance on a photo whose main illumination was the iPhone’s own flash"
"The Android-based phones tended to excel here, thanks in part to their manual override settings.But I’ll defend the iPhone’s camera from two directions"
"First, I noticed a curious phenomenon: when the iPhone 4 “screwed up? a shot, the Nikon P6000 (the “real? camera) tended to make the same mistake with a blown highlight or a bad color setting"
"So the iPhone is in good company.And secondly: the iPhone’s camera software is about a thousand miles ahead of either the camera app you get with the Droid X or the stock app that’s built into Android 2.2"
"The Android camera apps were a colossal pain in the butt to use"
"Non-responsive buttons, key features buried inside submenus, huge shutter lag .."
"on the whole, they aren’t apps that encourage you to take pictures for pleasure.The iPhone’s Camera app is lightning-fast: I could take a sequence of rapid-fire shots just by twitching the button"
"It launches quickly, you can switch in and out of the app efficiently, it’s streamlined and elegant"
"Bottom line: it helps you to take pictures"
"It wants you to succeed.Another keen feature of the iPhone 4: its new front-facing camera makes self-portraiture (and self-portraits-with-friends) a breeze"
"It’s just VGA resolution, but when you absolutely, positively, must get a picture of yourself with a friend, it’ll do.The iPhone 4 camera, although a huge leap forward, won’t take the place of your pocket point-and-shoot"
"The real win is that for the first time, the camera that you happen to have with you wherever you go is now a very credible, “real? camera capable of taking printable, enlargeable, and frameable photos.In fact, every photo of the iPhone that you see in this article was, in fact, shot with a second iPhone 4"
"I could have walked into the other room and grabbed one of my "real" cameras, but I had the other phone right here next to me and I knew it'd do a spiffy enough job.Video, VideoThe iPhone 4’s rear-facing camera also shoots 720P HD video at a full 30 frames per second"
"This feature isn’t quite the same sort of breakthrough as the phone’s still camera"
"It shoots terrific video, but you still need to append the suffix “.."
"considering that it’s a cameraphone.?It has the problems you may have come to expect from phone video"
"You can blame the software, blame the hardware, or blame your shaky grip .."
"whatever the reason, iPhone 4 video tends to be very jittery unless you take pains to keep the camera steady while you shoot and you try very hard not to move around"
"Some digital video stabilization would have come in handy here.You’ll also experience the famous CMOS-censor “rubber shutter? effect as you pan across a scene"
"And don’t expect miracles from the audio, either"
"It can handle a nearby, centered subject very well, but any background room noise will quickly collapse into an annoying waterfall of vuvuzuela-like buzzing in the recording.The iPhone’s new HD video feature certainly doesn’t signal a death knell for conventional video cameras .."
"not even for the popular Flip cameras"
"In side-by-side tests, the Flip Utra HD consistently produced steadier and more attractive video, with much better sound"
"That said, the video camera can shoot some astonishingly clear and sharp images, with punchy colors"
"See the photo gallery for a couple of still frames I grabbed from iPhone HD video.And when the camera app is in video mode, it lets you use some of the still camera’s most useful features"
"The LED illuminator works in video mode (you can even turn it on and off in mid-recording), as does tap-to-focus"
"That means you can start a shot on your family in the foreground, and then tap on the Statue of Liberty to shift focus to the background"
"That’s a pretty cool trick for a cameraphone.As with the still camera, you can tap a button and shoot video from the iPhone’s front-facing camera .."
"again, limited to VGA resololution"
"Hey, how’s anyone going to believe that you actually met the guy who played the dad on “My Two Dads? (no, the other one) unless you get some video of the two of you together?iMovie for iPhoneApple released an iPhone edition of their iMovie video editor"
"It’s a $4.99 download from the App Store and well worth the price of a “People? magazine.iMovie allows you to assemble a fairly sophisticated video from all of the clips you’ve shot with the iPhone"
"Transitions, inserting photos from your camera roll, themes, titles, and background music are all supported"
"It isn’t the full edition of the desktop iMovie, but bloody hell"
"It’s a remarkable thing to be cutting a video together on a smartphone.In fact, it might even be a more useful editor than the desktop edition"
"I often shoot video when I travel, but I almost never get around to editing it together"
"Producing a video always seems like such .."
"a production"
"But on the iPhone 4, it’s almost like playing a game on your handset"
"Editing video is exceptionally-well suited to a multitouch OS; it’s a snap to just drag in clips from your video library and push and pull them together like lumps of clay"
"The iPhone’s processor can keep up for you, move for move"
"It’s made me very, very keen to see a version of this app on the iPad.The results can be uploaded directly to YouTube or MobileMe, or saved as an HD movie back into your video library"
"You can then email it to friends or copy it onto your desktop.FaceTimeA forward-facing camera isn’t a new thing .."
"nor is the ability to video chat via a phone"
"But with the iPhone’s FaceTime feature, mobile video chat isn’t a stunt feature that you’ll play with once or twice and then completely ignore"
"And for a simple reason: unlike the rest of the video chat systems out there, it isn’t more trouble than it’s worth"
"If the desire strikes you, you can dial a number and be video chatting with someone seconds later.Video chatting via FaceTime is almost anticlimactic"
"You place a phone call to another iPhone, or any device that supports FaceTime (more on this later)"
"You have a phone conversation"
"At any point, you can press the onscreen FaceTime button"
"A second or three later, you’re seeing and hearing the person you were just talking to.You don’t need to hang up and call a new number, you don’t need to set up an account on an intermediary service, and you certainly don’t need to have a long and detailed conversation ahead of time with this person to explain how to get everything set up properly.All you need is a WiFi connection (FaceTime doesn’t work on the 3G network yet)"
"The phone invisibly moves the call from the cell network to the WiFi network, negotiates with the other device, and starts everything spinning"
"Use of the WiFi doesn’t eat into any of your voice or data minutes.Video is smooth and fluid; audio is crisp and clear"
"You can use the front-facing camera or shoot with the back cam, operating it like a camcorder.It just plain works .."
"so long as your friends and relatives have iPhone 4’s, that is"
"But soon, thousands of non-Apple devices might be compatible with FaceTime: Apple is promoting it as an open standard.(You are about to witness one of the greatest similes that will be published in any medium in 2010"
"Call in the kids and read this next bit aloud to them"
"It’ll be a cherished family memory for decades to come.)It turns out that FaceTime is like an Egg McMuffin and not like Coca-Cola"
"Coke is a combination of many readily-available ingredients plus the mysterious, top-secret, and proprietary Merchandise “X? that turns a Cola into a Coke"
"When Apple created the FaceTime standard, they combined existing, open, off-the-shelf standards for network communication, handshaking, and media streaming into a new recipe, creating a technique that practically anybody can replicate.So it’s certainly possible that by this time next year, FaceTime will be available on multiple handsets from multiple carriers, running on multiple operating systems .."
"possibly even including desktops"
"For now, it’s an iPhone 4-only club.I’ll believe it when I see it"
"Apple has a couple of things going for it, though: they’ve had success promoting open standards that fit in with its business strategy in the past"
"And which when you think of it, FaceTime represents the strongest of all possible strong-arm tactics in family marketing.“Well, sure, Dad .."
"I suppose you could buy an Android-based phone, if that’s what you really want,? a seven-months-pregnant daughter will say via email"

"Oh, well, no worries .."
"his other grandpa is buying an iPhone"
"I suppose little Tralfaz will just form an unseverable lifelong bond with him instead…?iPhone 4 PotpourriLet’s go around the horn and pick up a few bits and pieces that didn’t merit the full operatic presentation:The iPhone 4’s battery life is just fine"
"The insides of a disassembled iPhone 4 appear to be at least 50 percent battery"
"The iPhone’s definitely up to the challenge of powering that power-hungry screen"
"Precise measurements of battery life are fairly meaningless but in the past five days of testing, the battery proved to be easily capable of powering the iPhone 4 through a day of conventional, intermittent use, or four hours of heavy use (walking around the city taking lots of photos).It’s still a good idea to pay close attention to battery charge status"
"Many of the iPhone 4’s operations, such as recording HD video, are highly processor-intensive"
"It might take you a few days to figure out how many miles you can go on a single tank of gas.Audio quality"
"The new iPhone adds a noise-canceling mic that has a definite positive impact on sound quality"
"Alas, it doesn’t kick in when recording video .."
"and there’s been no upgrade to the iPhone’s built-in speakers"
"But it seems to be a help when issuing voice commands in a car.Volume and clarity are Adequate when using the iPhone’s speakerphone, but it’s still about one click or two too soft.And Now There’s A Gyroscope"
"An internal digital gyroscope allows apps to sense the minutest changes in the iPhone’s pitch, roll, and yaw"
"A game like Ngmoco’s “Eliminate: Gun Range? shows off the level of precision possible with the new hardware"
"When you swing the sight of your gun through Eliminate’s gun range, it feels more like you’re operating the iPhone’s video camera; the slightest movement of the phone translates to an instantaneous and precise shift in your point of view"
"In accelerometer-based gaming, it’s more like twitching a joystick and indicating a vague direction.There are obvious uses for this precision in augmented reality apps"
"But clearly, the primary beneficiary of this new gyroscope will be the iPhone’s game library.iOS 4 and the Coming of the iPad NanoI said at the top of this review that the iPhone 4 felt like a “new? iPhone as opposed to an “improved? one.Clearly that’s because of the new display, which truly dazzles"
"And the still camera"
"If you’re more of a “snapshot? photographer, it won’t make much of an impression on you but anybody who values the ability to capture a great image at any moment will be pretty thrilled with the iPhone 4’s camera capabilities.But the new iPhone 4 hardware coupled with the new features of iOS 4 elevate the iPhone’s game considerably"
"It shares so much DNA with the iPad — including its actual CPU, Apple’s own A4 — that at times, it feels like a mini-iPad.At times, you can even use it like a mini-iPad"
"Many of the iPad’s most convenient and powerful features, like the mechanism for moving your documents into and off of the device via iTunes or the cloud, are part of iOS 4"
"I actually wrote last week’s print edition of this review (a merciful 600 words) on the iPhone 4, using a Bluetooth keyboard"
"Writing and editing operations were responsive and zippy, a notable improvement over the 3GS.Yeah, yeah .."
"big deal"
"“That kind of thing has been possible on Nokia and other kinds of phones for years.? If you’ll scroll back, you’ll see that I went ahead and made that very point right at the top.Much of the strength of a piece of technology comes not via the features that it presents, but by the perceptions and expectations it inspires"
"Is this thing in my shirt pocket a phone"
"Is it a content-consumption device"
"Is it a palmtop computer?On that basis, what happens when my ebook reader has a rudimentary web browser?Should I be disappointed that it does such a poor job of reformatting every page"
"Or should I be delighted that it even has that feature to begin with?It’s overreaching to say that the iPhone 4 defines a whole new class of phone .."
"much less a whole new class of computing"
"No"
"It’s just superb next iteration of a phone that was pretty fab to begin with"
"It doesn’t even complicate consumers’ buying decision"
"Out with the old models, in with the new ones: the 16 gig model is $199; double the amount of storage for another $100"
"But it sharpens the distinction between the iPhone and 2010’s impressive graduating class of Android devices"
"A month ago, I think you could have said that the differences between an iPhone 3GS running iPhone OS 3 and those of a Nexus One running the new edition of the Android OS were largely philosophical and political"
"Today, iPhone and Android are once again two very different beasts"
"Declaring one to be the winner over the other is like betting on a fight between a hippo and a giant octopus"
"Each will have its fans and its supporters, but these are clearly two beasts with two very different ideas about how to stay on Darwin’s good side.The iPhone 4 isn’t a revolution"
"But damn, it’s interesting"
"It’s that first little turn of the focusing knob that makes the line between “phone? and “computer? a little tougher to make out"
"It seems to beg for high expectations.Block-circling queues, midnight campers and stores with all the stock wrung out of them: it can only be a new iPhone"
"Apple’s iPhone 4 has landed and it’s taking no prisoners"
"Packing the freshly-released iOS4 with a slimmed-down, powered-up hardware, as ever the promise is not so much ticks on the spec sheet but a superlative user experience"
"Is the iPhone 4 another home run, or – in a market of rivals it helped motivate – has Apple lost its edge"
"Check out the full SlashGear review after the cut.HardwareThis fourth-generation hardware marks a significant design departure for Apple, eschewing the curved plastic of the last couple of iPhones and replacing it with glass, metal and squared off edges"
"The fascia is a single sheet of toughened Gorilla Glass, supposedly 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic is, while the outer bezel is stainless steel and integrates the GSM/UMTS, GPS, WiFi and Bluetooth antennas for improved performance"
"At 4.8oz in the hand it’s solid and pleasantly weighty, while Apple’s opting for a non-user-accessible battery means there’s no battery door to creak or flex.Hardware controls are limited to a power/sleep button on the top edge, a ringer switch on the top left hand side, volume up/down buttons just beneath it and the usual home key under the display"
"On the bottom edge is the dock connector, flanked by two speaker grills, while a 3.5mm headphone jack sits up on the top"
"The front-facing camera is just visible alongside the speaker grill, while on the back is the main camera and the new LED flash above the traditional shiny Apple logo.The SIM slot – now taking a smaller microSIM like the iPad WiFi + 3G – has moved from the top edge to the right side, and there are now two microphones, one on top and one on the bottom, used for noise cancellation.All in all it’s slimmer and slicker than the iPhone 3GS it replaces, and neatly distinct from much of its rivals on the market"
"Best of all, perhaps, it’s very obviously a new handset; the 3GS came in for some criticism by virtue of its being physically identical to the 3G, leaving those who had upgraded with no visible sign that they’d done so"
"That may sound shallow, but it’s nonetheless a real consideration for many consumers and will help differentiate the iPhone 4 in-store.Retina DisplayTurn the handset on, however, and you all but forget the physical design: Apple’s so-called Retina Display is eye-wateringly impressive, setting a new bar in smartphone screens performance"
"According to Apple’s official stats, it’s a 960 x 640 3.5-inch IPS LCD panel with 326 pixels per inch, an 800:1 contrast ratio and 500 cd/m2 brightness"
"As before there’s an oleophobic oil-resistant coating – that’s applied to the back of the iPhone 4 too – which, while the handset is still prone to picking up prints, means it’s an easy matter to wipe them off again.Specs aside, the iPhone 4′s display is frankly the best mobile display on the market so far"
"AMOLED/Super AMOLED advocates will likely argue which technology has the better contrast, richer colors or inkiest blacks, but the real magic is in the extreme pixel density"
"On stage at WWDC 2010, Steve Jobs described Retina Display as having more pixels than the eye can see, marketing hyperbole that prompted another round of arguments, but in short, at the kind of average distance most users hold their handsets at, the individual pixels are simply too small to be differentiated between.Galaxy S brightness still falls short of iPhone 4′s Retina Display.iPhone 4: 3.5-in Retinal Display (below) vs"
"Samsung Galaxy S: 4-in Super-AMOLED (above)iPhone 4 vs Galaxy S in direct sunlight (unedited)Retina Display allows for much better viewing than Super AMOLED when viewed through a pair of Polarized sunglasses.Brightness on MAXIMUM for both devicesAs you might expect, that has a huge impact on graphics and text"
"Even the basic iOS4 homescreen, familiar now to anyone with an iPhone 3G or 3GS, looks rejuvenated, with icons crisp and detailed"
"Load up the browser, meanwhile, and that pixel density means – as long as your eyesight is up to it – you can make out text at far lesser levels of zoom than on the last generation handset"
"It’s a little like moving from a small-screen phone to one of the current breed of 4.3-inch devices like the HTC EVO 4G or forthcoming 4-inch Super AMOLED Samsung Galaxy S, and discovering you can see much more of a webpage at the default zoom than you could before, only far better"
"Developers using the new iOS4 SDK will be able to rework their apps to take advantage of all those extra pixels, but Apple has built in some intelligent rendering so that non-updated software doesn’t look entirely bad"
"Still, it’s a good incentive for updates, particularly in games which look, frankly, stunning on the iPhone 4.ConnectivityConnectivity remains broad, with a few key changes over the 3GS; there’s still quadband 850/900/1900/2100 UMTS/HSPA and quadband GSM/EDGE, together with Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, WiFi b/g/n (though only single band 2.4GHz 802.11n, not dual-band like the Apple Airport Express supports) and A-GPS"
"As before there’s a digital compass and accelerometer, plus proximity and ambient light sensors that control the iPhone’s display during use, but Apple has also slotted in a three-axis gyroscope"
"This allows for far more precise interpretation of what orientation in 3D-space the iPhone 4 is being held in, and was well received by game developers at WWDC 2010.There’s still no standard USB 2.0 port, only the proprietary Apple Dock Connector, and still no expandable memory slot"
"Two versions of the iPhone 4 will be offered, as with the last-gen 3GS, with either 16GB or 32GB of storage (a “new? 8GB 3GS has been slotted in as the $99 entry-level handset)"
"We’ve a feeling Apple buyers are used to the absence of, say, a microSD card slot, and we’re not entirely sure where on the iPhone 4 it could have been accommodated, but it’s something to bear in mind if you’re wanting to take advantage of the Retina Display’s excellence at playing high-bitrate video.Inside, squeezed into the narrower chassis, is the same Apple A4 processor as powers the iPad"
"In addition to the 1GHz chip they’ve also doubled the RAM, which is now 512MB rather than the 256MB of the iPad and iPhone 3GS"
"The end result is, unsurprisingly, the fastest iPhone to-date, whipping between homescreen pages, booting apps in record time, and generally being lag-free.CameraWhile they may have protested otherwise, photography has always been a weak point in iPhone handsets (though that hasn’t stopped owners from making hefty use of the camera)"
"Happily the iPhone 4 marks a significant step up on that front"
"There are now two cameras: one, a 5-megapixel unit with autofocus and a single LED flash, on the back for general photography and video recording, and the second, a VGA-quality camera embedded in the front of the smartphone, and used for video calls"
"As we’re seeing from other manufacturers of late, Apple has signed up to the “it’s not just megapixels? message, pointing to other factors like sensor size and lens quality as just as – or more – important"
"While at 5-megapixels it’s not the highest resolution camera in a smartphone on the market – there are several with 8MP, and Nokia’s N8 will bring 12MP when it launches later this year – Apple say they’ve made sure pictures benefit from careful design rather than plumping for the biggest sensor that could fit in.It’s a decision that shows in the end results, with still photos being a significant step up from what the 3GS could produce"
"Not only are colors and detail more accurate, but there’s less of the cellphone “fuzz? that often works as a giveaway that a cameraphone’s smaller lens was involved"
"Even without the LED flash, low-light performance is noticeably stronger, with indoor and evening shots losing their murkiness"
"The LED flash itself is, like most of its ilk, of limited benefit; there’s a relatively narrow sweet-spot in terms of range that, outside of which, images are either over- or under-illuminated, but it’s serviceable all the same"
"Controls still err on the side of simplicity, with touch-to-focus control, a 5x digital zoom, manual flash settings (that basically amount to on/off and auto) and a shutter release button; we’d love to see a dedicated hardware camera key, since we imagine the iPhone 4 is going to replace a lot more dedicated digicams.Thanks to the boosted processor speed, both loading up the camera app and actually taking pictures is faster than before, and there’s less chance that you’ll miss the shot waiting for the iPhone to catch up"
"720p HD video recording is also supported, with Apple claiming full 30fps framerates, and you can use the LED flash as a video light"
"This proved roughly on a par with one of the point-and-shoot camcorders available from Flip, Kodak and others, though you’ll need a steady hand since there’s no image stabilization"
"$4.99 gets you iMovie for iPhone from the App Store, the mobile version of Apple’s video editing app, complete with a finger-friendly interface, various transitions, themes, effects and titling options"
"It’s unlikely to replace your use of the desktop version, but for trimming and combining a few clips for a mobile upload to YouTube it’s surprisingly usable"
"If anything, though, we do think Apple should have bundled iMovie with the iPhone 4 as Nokia are doing with their N8 video editing app, and it’s worth noting that the app exports in .MOV format which may need converting to play on devices outside of Apple’s ecosystem.iPhone 4 sample 720p HD videos Face TimeThe front camera, meanwhile, is designed for Apple’s new strike at the video calling market, something many others have attempted to kick-start and have had, for the most part, little success"
"Called FaceTime, the new app is currently exclusive to the iPhone 4, and is neatly integrated into the standard apps"
"Tapping the FaceTime button in Contacts starts a video call straight away, or you can switch from a regular cellular voice call to FaceTime midway through (though not, it’s worth noting, in the other direction)"
"There are a few provisos, as you might imagine for a new system, and which if it weren’t for Apple’s market appeal we might question FaceTime’s likelihood of success.FaceTime demo: First off is that you’ll need a WiFi network in order for FaceTime to work, since right now Apple won’t let video calls be made over cellular connections"
"That seems to be a decision based on network bandwidth, with Apple giving the carriers time to get their systems up to scratch; Steve Jobs hinted that the 3G situation may be reconsidered in 2011, though it’s possible that Apple could build in carrier opt-out as we’ve seen them do with tethering.Second, the person you’re calling will have to have an iPhone 4 themselves, since so far FaceTime only works on that one handset"
"Apple are opening up the APIs in the hope that other companies will pick them up and build in compatibility to their own devices, but that, again, will likely take some time"
"Of course, with record-breaking numbers of iPhone 4 pre-orders over the past week or so – and no sign of demand slowing down – there’s a good chance you may know someone out there with one of their own, so that compatibility question may not apply.In practice, the FaceTime experience feels a lot like iChat on the desktop – or, indeed, like video calling in Europe or Asia where the functionality has been available, cross-platform, for years now – with the screen dominated by the person you’re talking to and your own face in a PIP inset in the top corner"
"While defaulting to the front-facing camera, you can toggle between that and the rear camera – though not at the full 5-megapixel resolution – to show your surroundings, and FaceTime works in both landscape and portrait orientations"
"Image quality was reasonable over a broad WiFi connection, though when we tried using a MiFi-style mobile 3G router as a bridge we did notice some visual artifacts breaking in"
"We’re more than a little confused why Apple didn’t build in iChat desktop support, though, which would’ve instantly made the iPhone 4 more appealing as part of an existing ecosystem.iOS4The iPhone 4′s other headline software features have, ironically, been scooped by the iOS4 update Apple pushed out to the iPhone 3GS (and, less so, the 3G and iPod touch) late last week"
"The new version of iOS brings with it Apple’s answer to some of the more persistent criticisms of its mobile range, including multitasking support and a unified inbox, and if you’re a 3GS owner who finds iOS4′s feature list satisfies most complaints you have with your cellphone, you might find trying out the (free) update for a while saves you the cost of upgrading to the iPhone 4.As you might expect, given Apple’s vocal objection to multitasking in previous years, iOS4 handles multiple apps somewhat differently to how rival platforms approach it"
"Their argument has been that battery life suffers to an unacceptable degree when software is running in the background; hence on the iPhone 4 background apps aren’t in fact operational but are frozen in the state you left them"
"In effect it’s a type of caching, packaged with a handful of new APIs that developers can take advantage of"
"Those APIs allow for background audio, such as in streaming media apps like Pandora, to continue, as well as task completion, where uploads or syncs are finished even if you switch away from the app before it’s done"
"There’s also background GPS, which keeps navigation-centric apps updated with positioning data, and background VoIP, which allows apps such as Skype to stay on the look out for new incoming calls without having to be active all the time.The new caching and APIs are packaged together with an app switching dialog that, when you double-press the home button, pops up at the bottom of the display and allows you to flick between recently used titles"
"Of course there’s also the existing push notification system that triggers pop-ups when server-linked apps have a new update"
"It works well, overall, though the biggest drawback is that none of the new multitasking functionality is native; apps must be coded specially to take advantage of the APIs and of the caching"
"Without that support, the software will show up in the app switcher but you’ll be back to square one each time you return to it.iPhone 4 demo In effect, it’s a balance: a decision Apple has made between battery capacity and functionality users are used to from rival platforms"
"Barring rapid increases in battery technology, we can’t see them opening up “true? multitasking – where apps are left to run free and untended in the background – any time soon"
"For some that will be a deal breaker and push them toward webOS, Android or other platforms; for many, it will be sufficiently advanced that – with a little developer ingenuity to make best use of the APIs and other systems on offer – they may not notice the difference.You’ll certainly notice the difference with unified messaging in the iOS4 Mail app, and it kicks the iPhone 4 back into play with the best of email-centric smartphones"
"Hard to believe that it’s taken Apple so long to add a combined inbox, but now, as well as viewing each account separately, you can see one view with all new messages"
"There’s also conversation support: a small number appears to the right of a message in the inbox if there are subsequent replies to it, and tapping to view pulls out all of those replies into a single, easier to follow string.With the App Store now containing in excess of 200,000 titles, homescreen folders are ironically more useful than they sound"
"Drag any app icon onto another and a folder is automatically created, named by default according to the app’s category, but open to user customization too"
"Go heavy on the organization and you can quickly slim down 10+ full homescreen panes to just a couple of screens of folders"
"Curiously, though, Apple has limited each folder to just twelve apps, and there’s no support for nested folders: putting in a sub-folder to separate out, say, card games from your gaming folder.It’s not the only place we’d like to see improvement, either"
"iOS4′s app switching system is slick – the side-scrolling app manager bar is straightforward to use, and holding down on an icon lets you close it directly – but that only goes to highlight the frustrating pop-up notifications"
"With more and more apps running in the background and wanting to alert users to new updates, messages and status changes, it’s increasingly likely that whatever you’re doing will be punctuated at least once or twice with an on-screen dialog box"
"Unlike on rival platforms like Android or webOS, there’s no way to “ignore? the alert but still have it visible so as to remind you later on that something has changed: instead you have to deal with it there and then, or dismiss it altogether.We’d also like to see an iPhone 4 version of iPhoto, or at least some basic image editing tools on the handset"
"iMovie has shown that the 1GHz CPU is capable of HD video editing, so being unable to crop or tweak shots in the iPhone 4′s gallery seems particularly shortsighted"
"It’s worth noting that the smartphone is reliant on iPhoto on the desktop to handle facial recognition and galleries: you’ll need to set them up there and then sync to get them across onto the iPhone 4"
"Finally, we wish Apple would broaden its social networking integration, so that as well as emailing or MMS’ing images from the gallery we could upload them to Flickr, Facebook or other online galleries"
"That links in with a general shortage of social network awareness in iOS4 as standard; yes, there are apps which will tick those boxes, but they lack the wholehearted system integration that we’ve seen on rival platforms.PerformanceAs was made clear by the inevitable teardown, a fair amount of the iPhone 4′s chassis is taken up by its battery: in this case a 1,420 mAh Li-Polymer pack"
"Apple reckon you’ll see up to 300hrs standby, up to 7hrs 3G talktime or up to 14hrs 2GB talktime from a full charge, or alternatively up to 6hrs 3G internet browsing, 10hrs over WiFi, 10hrs of video playback or 40hrs of audio"
"In reality we’ve found the fourth-gen handset manages around 25-percent longer runtime than its predecessor, with mixed use"
"For instance, after around six minutes of voice calls, replying to thirty-odd emails and twenty minutes of RSS reading, the iPhone 4 dropped from 100-percent to 90-percent"
"Still, it’s relatively early days yet, and we’ll be watching closely to see how the iPhone 4 performs over the next week or so before revisiting battery life.We’ll also be keeping track of how AT&T handles calls and whether the improvements – both that Apple has made to the iPhone 4 and the carrier claims to have made to their network – make a significant impact"
"Poor voice call performance has been an ongoing criticism of all three prior generations of iPhone, a persistent thorn in Apple’s performance paw"
"For their part, Apple claim to have changed the way the smartphone prioritizes network selection, with the iPhone 4 picking a base station band not solely on signal strength but on available capacity"
"That way, the company reckons, users won’t be faced with the confusing situation where the iPhone says it has a strong signal but calls drop nonetheless.That change in measurement has made it difficult to gauge the extent to which our iPhone 4 demonstrates the same antenna issues as have been widely reported and which Apple has acknowledged"
"In short, the switch to making the antennas external has meant that, if a user’s hand bridges the two and is sufficiently damp to prove conductive, the iPhone 4 can lose signal dramatically"
"It’s certainly something we can replicate, though we had to hold the handset in a way we wouldn’t usually do"
"Apple’s own Bumper case is one workaround, and it seems a physical case is generally the best solution; adhesive strips, like Fusion of Ideas’ StealthArmor, failed to address the signal problem as they were billed as doing"
"Now, some iPhone 4 owners are finding they naturally hold the handset in a way that doesn’t cause problems, or that their specific phone isn’t as prone to it anyway, but many are discovering they also need to budget for a case.No matter the changes, AT&T’s network continues to frustrate"
"We’ve suffered multiple dropped calls in every day of iPhone 4 use with the US carrier, and as before there’s little apparent connection between what’s shown in the status bar and what the network is actually capable of sustaining"
"Even more frustrating, perhaps, are the recurring “No SIM? errors in which the iPhone 4 and the AT&T MicroSIM seemingly become bored and stop responding to each other"
"We’re not sure whether it’s an Apple hardware issue – we’re seeing similar reports from multiple people, though predominantly in the US – or something to do with the carrier’s systems, but either way it demands a power-cycle before the two play nicely again.When you do manage to place a call, there’s an impressive improvement in audio quality"
"The iPhone 4′s dual microphones – used for active noise cancellation – left callers able to hear us even with traffic in the background"
"Meanwhile the speakerphone is also louder than on the 3GS, thanks, we’re guessing, to the new audio chamber also spotted in the teardown"
"Even so, you get a sense that Apple have tuned the iPhone 4 for data use, unsurprising perhaps given the number of apps that rely on network connectivity"
"There’s a significant improvement in 3G speeds over the iPhone 3GS that’s noticeable in day to day use, and the iPhone 4 is proving one of the fastest browsing devices on AT&T’s network that we’ve experienced.Outside of the US, meanwhile, Apple has opened its arms to embrace not only multiple carrier partners but official unlocked devices, seemingly deciding that if you can’t beat the unlockers then you may as well join them"
"In the UK and Canada, among other places, carriers are offering the iPhone 4 on subsidized deals while Apple themselves are selling unlocked, SIM-free (and full price) handsets"
"It’s a move that we can only see fueling the call for broader availability in the US, though without knowing the exact specifics of Apple’s exclusivity deal with AT&T it’s hard to say whether it’s a shift we can expect to see any time soon.AccessoriesAs for accessories, we’ve been trying out Apple’s iPhone 4 Dock which – as you might expect – works to charge and sync the smartphone, and also has a 3.5mm audio output for hooking up to your stereo"
"Thanks to the change in case shape, however, you won’t be able to use a 3GS in the dock, even though the Dock Connector port is the same"
"The official Bumper, meanwhile, is more a rubber band than it is a true case: both the front and back are left entirely exposed, with the Bumper stretching around the stainless steel band alone"
"In a neat touch, the Bumper doesn’t just use cut-outs for the volume and power buttons, but actually has integrated metal keys that press the true buttons underneath"
"We’re not entirely sure how much protection it will give, but given they cut out any reception issues based on how you hold the iPhone 4, we can see Bumpers being a popular accessory"
"They and the iPhone 4 Dock are $29 each.Wrap-upThe lingering question remains: despite the Steve Jobs hype and the Apple marketing, does the iPhone 4 continue to innovate or has the increasingly competitive smartphone market caught up to Cupertino’s finest"
"There’s no denying that, while the first-generation iPhone caught rivals unprepared, the segment as a whole has accelerated hugely in the intervening period"
"For consumers that’s hardly a bad thing, of course, though the record-breaking sales (1.7m iPhone 4 to be exact) and huge queues indicate there’s still a huge demand for Apple’s offering.That demand, and the support of the developer community, are a significant aspect in Apple’s favor"
"A good example is the gyroscope, new to the iPhone 4 but lacking any native software that actually makes use of it: Apple is able to bundle that feature and know that third-party app producers will make it shine"
"Many may protest at the heavily curated nature of the App Store, but to consumers it offers the promise that whatever they load shouldn’t leave their phone unstable"
"It’s an element that, even as Android Market content rises in number, Google can’t quite promise to users of their OS.Factor in what’s undoubtedly an attractive, appealing piece of hardware with excellent imaging skills, sufficient processor grunt to power the latest apps and games, and a display that puts most others to shame, and you’re getting to a very tempting package"
"At the launch of the iPhone 3GS, the difficult question was whether 3G owners should upgrade to the new, faster device, and many couldn’t quite justify the move"
"With the iPhone 4, however, it’s a more clean-cut choice: yes, you can get much of the iOS4 experience on your existing iPhone, but there’s also the brilliant Retina Display, far better camera and – antenna holding issues aside – improved wireless performance on offer from the new device.Apple knows it can’t afford to rest on its laurels – and they have to blame themselves in part for that; their own success has been a significant factor in driving the smartphone market – and the hardware capabilities of the iPhone 4 are part of a multi-stage approach that sees software releases as important as the physical device you sign a contract for"
"Our criticisms – such as the absence of photo editing or social network integration – are predominantly aspects that could be addressed in future iterations of iOS4, and it would be naive to assume Apple isn’t already looking at where next to take the platform.Out of the box, though, the iPhone 4 is one of the most polished, appealing smartphones on the market today"
"By boosting the camera, upgrading the screen and generally tightening up the whole user experience, Apple has neatly answered most of the complaints from previous models together with addressing some – like the Retina Display – we didn’t even know we had"
"The antenna issue is frustrating, certainly, but unlikely to be a deal-breaker, and the improvement in battery life is more than welcome; moreover, there’s something inherent in the iPhone 4 that goes beyond “just another? phone and demands you engage with it"
"Apple’s approach to mobile continues to polarize opinion, but for those with the acquired taste the iPhone 4 is Cupertino’s best yet and a strong contender for smartphone of 2010"
