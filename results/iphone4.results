I agree the original iPhone and iPhone 3g/gs created a new paradigm for smart phones, but I can not agree that they are a trend setter with the iPhone 4., Lets look at this analytically and not emotionally., The "innovative" features called out on the iPhone 4., Camera Flash, inovative, NO, Multi-tasking: NO, Folders NO, forward facing camera NO, Network technology NO, Interface: hasn't changed much since original iPhone NO, Battery life Unknown no real testing was performed., Retina display possibly, although I have to hold my iPhone 3gs so close I go cross eyed before I can see the pixels., I fail to see how this phone is full of innovation and is head and shoulders above the competition."Ever since the iPod no one else even comes close., 90% of the design, and specs of all the newest smartphones were..., "borrowed" from the iPhone."There is so much wrong with this comment I am not sure where to begin., 1st the iPod has nothing to do with the current phone manufactures unless your intent was that apple only began to make good products after the introduction of the iPod., 2nd  The newest top of the line smart phones don't share any of the specs of the iphone., If anything the iPhone has copied features of many of the current top of the line smart phones., If you compare the specs of the incredible or evo, the specs are comparable to the iPhone 4, if they don't exceed it., I am curious as to the iPhone 4's processor speed and ram., I am sure it is below the competition's 1GHz, and soon to be released 1.5GHz.I give apple credit for dragging the other smart phone manufactures kicking and screaming into building a better product., I think the days of the iPhone being far superior to the completion is over., I for one love competition., Captain  Obvious Posted Jun 23rd 2010 12:39AMHighest Ranked@Anarchist CHuck People all over the world will have to purchase a new calendar within the next twelve months, tekdemon Posted Jun 23rd 2010 12:46AMHighest RankedWell I think the review is pretty spot-on, except I personally feel that the wifi only facetime is so idiotic that it might kill the appeal of video calling., I mean, you have no idea if the people you're calling are logged into a wifi network, so not only are you only calling other iPhone 4 users you have to be calling them when they happen to have wifi availability?, That alone dooms it from actually being used except on extremely rare occasions (like when you're on a trip and want to show people something cool), since presumably you'd feel utterly ridiculous calling your friends up and telling them to go somewhere with wifi so you can chat with video.Which of course bring me to my main point-it's the networks holding this phone back., Or rather, the single network people have to choose from in the U.S., that would have crumbled from the usage if they had allowed facetime over 3G., Seriously, the iPhone needs a 4G network with lots of room to spare, and I don't mean 4G with a 2GB data cap and tons of restrictions on which apps can run on 4G.P.S., The camera is pretty nice for a phone but even with the backlit sensor the photos are insanely grainy and would really only look ok resized for web usage., DgDeBx Posted Jun 23rd 2010 1:29AMHighest RankedJosh, could you provide a link to that wallpaper?, Bskballa92 Posted Jun 23rd 2010 1:31AMNeutral@tekdemon  Well if someone else has an iPhone near you, they could tether you a wifi signal!, uberDoward Posted Jun 23rd 2010 1:32AMHighly Ranked@hey buddy  Good to see I'm not the only one getting 24+ hours of use out of his/her EVO 4G!, huzzlehoff Posted Jun 23rd 2010 1:48AMHighest Ranked@Anarchist CHuck Good phone, but not liking the review., Over positive toward the goodies, not really speaking about the cons., huzzlehoff Posted Jun 23rd 2010 1:50AMNeutral@huzzlehoff  Facetime seems to be the fail I expected it to be., jshamlin Posted Jun 23rd 2010 1:53AMNeutral@hey buddy  I sure was (with my Evo) and then after that I was able to surf the *entire* web instead of only sites without Flash and Java which is very cool because have to pay money for things like weather radar apps and other flash-based apps available for free on the web., appsman Posted Jun 23rd 2010 2:33AMHighest Ranked@kobioshi - Agreed., If not for Apple, and its pushing at least one carrier, mobile internet would still be VCast., The thought makes me cringe., thecreative Posted Jun 23rd 2010 3:05AMHighest Ranked@SomePerson  Competition has made the iPhone better., Competition makes all things better for the most part., But do look at the original Android software designs and prototype hardware., They were trying to make a better BlackBerry., If Apple hadn't shown the world that a touch screen based phone was the future then Android would of never shifted gears and began to focus on the iPhone and touch., So Android needs the iPhone and the iPhone needs Android., Just like the PC and Mac need each other., However, Windows Phone series 7 hasn't even shipped yet., Don't count them in the race till they actually put their horse on the track., phinn Posted Jun 23rd 2010 3:37AMNeutral@Anarchist CHuck Wow the iphone 4 looks incredible., Can't wait to get one., MuzikJay Posted Jun 23rd 2010 3:37AMHighest Ranked@UnderPaidOrphan  True though., I am definitely an Android fan and am currently waiting for my EVO to be delivered., BUT there is no denying that the iPhone 4 is a really great device., It takes amazing photos and great design and speed., I really wish other OS's would catch on to Apple's little animations as those are my favorite part of the phone lol., I can see though that they leave the icons as their UI to keep the phone snappy as well., HOWEVER, I still choose my EVO over it for various reasons which most can guess =) it's win-win though either way, Junyor Mynt Posted Jun 23rd 2010 4:15AMNeutral@Apple Rocks HTC Sucks  What is this an apple ad site or a tech chat., I don't care about apple's history, holdings, or conglomerate., It is a good looking phone., I especially like the display., All the same I am waiting for the Captivate., I enjoy the andriod feel a little more., Plus I like the touch wiz UI.Either way Apple is stepping it up., hell hound Posted Jun 23rd 2010 4:31AMLowest Rank@Bshaw1090  Maybe you should just accept the fact that the new iphone is way better than your android symbian phones, Greeniemax Posted Jun 23rd 2010 4:52AMLowest Rank@spartandre217  I seriously don't understand people who could actually compare EVO with iPhone 4.What's there to compare?, iPhone 4 knocks everything out of the world, it is the BEST thing right now money can buy, can't wait to get mine., hsueing3 Posted Jun 23rd 2010 7:13AMNeutral@Anarchist CHuck  I might just buy one if the white iPhone doesn't come out soon., Leachpunk Posted Jun 23rd 2010 7:41AMHighest RankedThe display in this phone is awesome, everything else is done on all other smart phones out there., But that display is unrivaled..., Apple manages to lead again in one area.., Now patiently awaiting all phones to have LCD IPS panels with LED backlighting., Parody Posted Jun 23rd 2010 7:55AMLow Ranked@Greeniemax  How exactly?, Its functionality finally matches my N95 from three years ago (except for the multitasking, it's still behind on that)., The interface was always super great, but what good does that do you if you can't actually use it for anything?The hardware and UI is great and very impressive, but actual functionality and OS has yet to do anything other than make me go ''meh''., huzzlehoff Posted Jun 23rd 2010 8:13AMNeutral@Greeniemax  Come on., Thats just BS., The Iphone doesn't really bring anything new in the mobile space., Only materials tops the competitors, personally I wouldn't give a rats ass about those things ass long ass the device doesn't break., Best phone, that just fanboyism, and I can't understand how Joshua can say such a twatty thing., Well that's Engadget journalism for ya., dswatson83 Posted Jun 23rd 2010 8:20AMNeutral@tekdemon  Apple did some great things with hardware but a single device can only appeal to so many people., If they threw out a 4"+ version of this phone with a 1750mAh battery, they could start taking on all markets., Also, while the hardware is good, it is hardly future proof., In a matter of months, there will be phones coming out by the dozens that will knock the socks out of the iphone in the specs and features department.And limiting Facetime to only iphone4 & only wifi has rendered it useless, That's a freaking classic!, "Song from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas????"Kids these days., ronaldo0501 Posted Jun 23rd 2010 9:03AMNeutral@hey buddy  Yup, I have installed a widget on my Evo and I get 24 -30 hours on a single charge., Evo and Android Rule!!!, Cold Dead Fingers Posted Jun 23rd 2010 9:05AMLowest Rank@jxc  You stupid moron!, Apple, not only had permission from Xerox to use the GUI, but they PAID for it in stock!!!!, Not only that, but, the gui they took?, Ya, that was the idea of a virtual space to place virtual things, a desktop., That HARDLY counts for all of the R&D spent on perfecting the desktop, from the Dock to wallpaper designed to relieve your stress., The only company that stole is Microsoft, with windows., And, would you looky, again, now, Google did it., I advise you stop being a lying prick before posting again., rockingtushar Posted Jun 23rd 2010 9:21AMLow Ranked@berkleyberkley2010 I agree the retina display is highly overrated., Apple is trying to fool the general public with their stupid high dpi philosophy., As for the guys at engadget they easily seem to forget super AMOLED which is technically superior to retina., I have 20:20 vision and I am not able to see any pixels at a normal distance in my droid., The build quality is fantastic., I would be a douche to say its not that impressive., The camera quality is really good., Apple hasn't given in to the megapixel myth and put in a large lens., As for the interface, I am sure google will make huge changes in gingerbread., After all they hired Matias Durate., WaltFrench Posted Jun 23rd 2010 9:49AMNeutral@tekdemon sez, ?Seriously, the iPhone needs a 4G network with lots of room to spare??Make that: the Whole World needs 4G to enjoy these features., And that includes the US, where the most-touted carrier has slow 3G so is moving to 4G sometime soon; Sprint has 4G that hopes to cover a third of the US population, assuming their somewhat cash-constrained partner can handle it; AT&T is looking to upgrade its 3G to close-to-4G speeds.And remember: the wireless providers don't behav like charities: YOU are going to pay for all this extra data., steel Posted Jun 23rd 2010 9:53AMNeutral@mfeigley  Now Josh, let's not use the inability of AT&T to handle a phone launch as the standard for a big launch., We all know they suck at pretty much everything but collecting fees.,

of sorely needed features, both by itself and through the iOS 4 update., The bad: Multitasking entails some trade-offs, and home screen folders are limited to 12 apps., AT&T reception continues to be spotty, and you'll need a case for the best calling reception., Also, we'd prefer a 64GB model., The bottom line: With the iPhone 4, Apple again shows that it is a powerful player in the smartphone wars., It won't be for everyone, the call quality and reception vary if you don't use a case, and AT&T's network remains a sticking point, but the handset's striking design, loaded feature set, and generally agreeable performance make it the best iPhone yet., Average user rating  3.0 stars  out of 306 user reviews   My Rating  0 stars  you have not rated this yet Write Review, CNET Community

Summary:  The minute you pick up the iPhone 4 (I'm going to call it 4), you know its high quality stuff., It's this thin, expensive feeling hardware., It's weird to hold it, because you're not used to this such build-quality., Now, the cameras on the 4 are interesting., Taking pictures is so quick, and I can press the button 4 times in a row with half a second between, and get 4 (fairly) clear photos., Video is pretty nice too., It rolls a bit (meaning things get skewed if you turn too quickly), but when just walking, it's fine., My only gripe with the new camera is that I can't change the white balance, add a tint, black and white, etc., I just want to edit the photos, without having to get another app to do it.The iPhone UI is, well it just is., Nothing particularly spectacular pops out., It's super fast, thanks to the A4, but otherwise it's what I've had for the last 3 years., Multitasking is nice, but not all apps work yet., Folders is good, but only 12 apps?, The one thing I really like about Apple in general, is they fixed little things, and the fixes shave just a little time off., For example, adding a contact is very quick., No more switching pages to add a name, going back, switching pages to enter the number, etc., It's all on one page, and works., I've found that all of the phone it seems.The battery is splendid., It lasts quite long too., Although I'm not getting 24 hours, I did get 18 last night, with video playing from youtube, and going to my twitter and e mail client.Cell Reception is improving, trust me., I get 2 bars on my 3G, and get 4 on my 4., It's improving., If they could just ease up on the dropped calls...THE BOTTOM LINE: If you want a (very, very) full featured phone, that just works, quickly and beautifully, get a 4., If you want a phone that will last at least a day with you doing what you always do, get a 4., If you need a phone that has a high megapixel camera, get something else., If you want a phone without dropped calls, get a new carrier., But I think once you see this for yourself, and play with it, and use it, you will just want it., Isn't that the way it is with all Apple products, though?, "Loving the iPhone

Photo gallery:Apple iPhone 4  Editors' note: In light of Apple's decision to offer free cases for the iPhone 4's antenna, we are not changing our original iPhone's 4 rating., We are, however, withholding the Editors' Choice rating because of the attenuation issues that we experienced., We updated this review November 22, 2010, to reflect the new features from iOS 4.1 and 4.2., With a revamped design, a sparkling new display, a speedy processor, and additional features, the iPhone 4 is the biggest upgrade to Apple's smartphone since the iPhone 3G., It's also the showcase handset for Apple's newest operating system, iOS 4, which adds a selection of long-overdue features, plus some smaller tweaks that we weren't expecting., If they existed independently, iPhone 4 and iOS 4 wouldn't be much more than blips on the smartphone radar screen., When combined into one handset, however, the result is a sleek, satisfying, and compelling device that keeps Apple strongly competitive in an increasingly crowded marketplace., Indeed, the iPhone 4 is fast, the new hardware is a looker, and some of the new features blew us away., On other points, however, we have some concerns., Call reception still is problematic, and you'll need to use a case or bumper to avoid any issues with touching the new antenna., On the features side, we welcome multitasking with open arms, but it has its drawbacks., Also, though the FaceTime video calling feature is more than noteworthy, we wonder if our interest will last longer than a week., So, should you buy it?, If you're an iPhone fan, you've probably already ordered your new baby., But if you're on the fence, think carefully., We won't say that the iPhone 4 is the best smartphone on the market today., To do so would ignore so many great competing handsets, not to mention the fierce rate of change in the technology world., If you prefer Apple's vision of a polished, highly organized, and slightly closed user experience, then by all means you'll be pleased., Just remember to get that free case., But if you prefer a smartphone that offers more personalization, that isn't shackled to AT&T, or that is equal parts phone and mobile computer, then there are plenty of smartphones in the sea., The iPhone 4 is available exclusively with AT&T in the U.S., and with other carriers around the world., With a new two-year contract, AT&T customers will pay $299 for the 32GB model or $199 for the 16GB version., Without a contract, you'll pay $699 or $599, respectively, but the phone will still come locked to AT&T., Design
Though the iPhone 3G and the 3GS models simply tweaked the original handset's design, iPhone 4 marks a sharp departure from those previous models., Admittedly, we never had a problem with the look of the previous handsets, but we approve of the iPhone 4's changes., The front and back sides are glass, both surfaces are flat, and a stainless steel border circles the entire phone., Though it's a tad boxy, it also has a clean, svelte, and unmistakably Apple look., What's more, we love that the flat back means that the phone no longer wobbles when resting on a table., You can get the iPhone 4 in both black and white, but here again we prefer the former., The iPhone 4's rear face is made of glass., So much glass is shiny and beautiful, but we have a couple of concerns., Despite the oleophobic coating on both the front and back sides, the glass attracts smudges by the ton., Also, even though Apple CEO Steve Jobs promises that glass better resists scratches and cracks than plastic, we'll be watching long-term durability., The iPhone 4 has a solid, sturdy feel, though we didn't love its sharp corners., It survived a few drops to a carpeted floor, but we wonder how it will withstand traveling in a pocket with keys and coins., Luckily, the Apple-supplied bumper will offer needed protection, even if it takes away from the handset's sleek profile., Time will tell how it holds up to heavy use., The iPhone 4 (left) compared with the iPhone 3G., At 4.5 inches tall by 2.3 inches wide by 0.37 inch deep, the iPhone 4 is as tall as the iPhone 3GS, but slightly thinner--25 percent, to be exact--and narrow when measured across its front face., It does feel smaller when compared with its predecessors, but we don't think that's a bad thing., Jobs called it the thinnest smartphone around, but since that race changes daily, it may not hold the title for long., When put on the scales it comes in at 4.8 ounces, which is back to what we had with the first iPhone (both the 3G and 3GS models were slightly lighter)., We attribute the extra girth to the bigger battery, so we're not going to complain., And more to the point, the difference is barely noticeable., User controls
Other new design elements include a new front-facing VGA camera, a new LED flash with the main camera lens, and a new noise-cancellation microphone on the phone's top side., Needless to say, we welcome the additions since they represent new functionality (See the Features section for more details)., We also don't mind the new split volume buttons, since they're a bit easier to grasp than the previous volume rocker., The handset has a sturdy feel in the hand., Above the volume controls is the usual mute switch, which Apple also gave a small makeover., In bigger changes, Apple moved the SIM card slot to the right spine and switched to a Micro-SIM format, just like the iPad., According to Jobs, the Micro-SIM format allows more space for the larger battery., Just keep in mind that you won't be able to use a standard SIM in the phone., The remaining exterior elements are largely unchanged., The Home button is in its normal place below the display; the 3.5mm headset jack and power key sit up top next to the aforementioned noise-cancellation microphone; and the 30-pin connector, microphone, and speaker are where they belong on the iPhone 4's bottom end., Unfortunately, and to no one's surprise, you still can't remove the battery., In the box come the usual accessories, like the small wall plug, a USB/30-pin connector cable, and the standard Apple earbuds., Oddly, you do not get the SIM removal tool that came with the previous models., True, you can use a small paper clip, but we're miffed that we didn't get it., Apple didn't have an explanation for the omission., Antennas
The stainless steel border is more than just decorative; it doubles as two new antennas that circle the entire phone, minus three small notches., Seriously, leave it to Apple's industrial design team to make an antenna pretty., The first antenna, which runs from the notch on the top of the phone to the notch on the left side, is for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth., That leaves the second antenna, which spans from the top notch down the right side and around to the bottom of the phone, for EDGE and 3G., Though Apple did not specifically promise that the new antennas would improve call quality or Wi-Fi reception, their very existence is an indirect admission (and the first that we've seen by the company) that data and voice reception have been troublesome and need to be addressed., Though current iPhone users largely blame AT&T for connectivity problems, remember that both a carrier's network and a phone's antenna play a part in reception., Yet, as we mention below in the Performance section, the antenna didn't magically cure all reception issues., In fact, it even caused new problems., Display and interface
Sometimes the best gift is something that you didn't know you wanted, and that's definitely the case with the iPhone 4's display., It features a 940x640-pixel (326 pixels per square inch) "Retina Display," which is four times the resolution of previous iPhone models., What's more, it uses the same IPS screen that's found on the iPad, with an 800:1 contrast ratio., Though we've always thought highly of the current iPhone displays, the company needs to compete with the gorgeous AMOLED screens and TFT displays we've seen on many Android phones like the HTC Evo 4G., And that's exactly what it's done., The iPhone's display is beautiful., Just above is the VGA camera lens., Though "stunning," "gorgeous," and "dazzling" are words we usually use to describe high-quality smartphone displays, we're not sure if they do the iPhone 4 justice., Believe us that everything about this display is fantastic, from the bold colors and graphics to the vividly clear text., You can see it reasonably well in direct light and the details on Web pages, photos, videos, and applications are as sharp as they come., But the best thing is that you can't see any pixels on the display., It's quite remarkable and especially apparent when you hold it up next to the 3GS., No, we're not inclined to completely believe Apple's claim that the display exceeds what's perceivable by the human eye, but there's no denying that it looks good., We haven't seen the yellow areas that users have complained about., For more on the display, see the full testing results from CNET Labs., Of course, the iPhone 4 has the same ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, and accelerometer as the previous iPhones., We saw no change in their functionality., We would have liked to see how Flash videos tested on the display, but you know how that goes., Features
With a heavy load of new goodies, the iPhone 4 runs circles around its 3GS predecessor in bringing new features., Some are unique to the device, and others come with the iOS 4 update., We'll cover the latter group first., Multitasking: Though you've always been able to multitask with native iPhone features like the music player, the option is now available for third-party apps., Your primary access point is a multitasking menu that's accessible by double-tapping the Home button., Once there, you'll see a list of currently running applications along the bottom of the display that you can scroll through using a sideways finger swipe., The pop-up menu shows only four apps at a time, but you can keep many more in the tray., The new multitasking feature is accessible by double-tapping the Home button., Managing the multitasking menu couldn't be easier., To open a running app, scroll though the menu and tap its icon once., When you're ready to end an app, first use a long press on the related icon and then click the tiny delete icon in the top left corner., Switching among apps is a simple process as well: as you move back and forth, you'll return to the exact point you left., There's also a clear sense of organization, with the most recently used app on the left side., All things considered, it's a very Apple experience., But is it real?: As you'd expect, Apple's multitasking works a little differently than on other smartphones., Instead of having all device resources available to every running app, iOS 4 lets only seven app services run in the background., According to Apple, this arrangement will have less of a drain on resources like battery life and memory than if it gave developers free rein., Also, since background apps essentially pause, it will free the system from having to juggle resources and kill stalled applications., So what can you do in the background?, Apple's seven approved processes include audio (you'll be able to play Pandora radio, for example), VoIP services like Skype, GPS/location for apps like TomTom, push notifications, and local notifications (those that don't to have to go through a server), task completion, and fast app switching (apps essentially hibernate not to use the CPU)., The latter two are most notable., With task completion, an app will finish something it's already started even if you send it to the background; it will send you an alert when it's through., Fast app switching, on the other hand, is the app hibernation process that allows you to toggle back and forth quickly and return to the same place you left., Though some have complained that the built-in limitations mean that iOS 4 doesn't have "real" multitasking, we think "incomplete" is a better description., Granted, you can't run everything in the background--your Twitter feed, for example, won't update while paused--but iOS 4 does allow you to run certain features from multiple apps simultaneously., If that isn't multitasking, then we don't know what is., What's more, it wouldn't be the first time Apple limited features or took longer with development in order to produce a desired customer experience., You may not agree with such a philosophy, but Apple has always been honest about pursuing it., Like so many things in technology, it just comes down to what works best for you., You can close apps in the multitasking menu., Nice, but not miles ahead: Even after the long wait, we're quite pleased with the multitasking experience., As it has a talent for doing, Apple has presented the feature in a slick, easy-to-use manner., It performed beautifully, without ever crashing or freezing the phone; it didn't appear to negatively affect battery life; and it accomplishes what it sets out do., But even with strong points, we wouldn't agree that it's the "the best" way to multitask (a common Apple claim)., It may be slick and save you a few clicks, but other approaches--such as the "deck of cards" interface on WebOS--continue to impress., Similarly, though limited multitasking may result in more-efficient power management, we'll have to run comparison testing with other smartphones before we can agree., We also don't share Jobs' view that Apple's solution isn't a task manager., When he unveiled iOS 4 last April, Jobs took a dig at Android and other operating systems that require you to close background applications that might be slowing down the phone., "In multitasking, if you see a task manager...they blew it," he said., "Users shouldn't ever have to think about it." Fair enough, but we think it's a matter of semantics., As with most task managers, the iOS 4 multitasking menu allows you to scan through running applications and close any that you're no longer using., Granted, you may not have to kill frozen applications as often as you would on, say, a Windows Mobile phone, but you still have that option., We also found usability quirks that are common with task manager apps., Pressing the Home button once, for example, simply sends an app to the background; it does not end it completely., To do so, you'll need to open the multitasking menu, find the related icon, and end it there., And we couldn't overlook another point: now that a double-tap of the Home button opens the multitasking menu, you can no longer use the control as a shortcut for a designated feature., As such, the option is gone from the Setting menu., A small price to pay for a new feature, we suppose., Apps will come: We know that some CNET users are concerned that many existing apps are not functioning in the background., Keep in mind that it will take time for developers to update their apps for multitasking capability., Apple plays no rule in making those updates, so contact the individual developers for a time frame., Home screen folders: Though we love apps as much as the next person, we've become tired of scrolling through several pages of iPhone home screens., Thankfully, that has changed with the addition of home screen folders., This is another common feature that competing devices have long offered, so it's nice to see Apple stepping up., Folders clear up space on your home screen., To get started, use a long press on the home screen so the icons "jiggle." When your icons are dancing (they'll also have a tiny delete icon in the corner), you can take an app and drop it on top of another to create a folder., The folder will then appear as a square with tiny icons of the included app inside., Tap the folder to access the included apps and get an expanded view of the folder's contents., Alternatively, if you want to remove an app, just drag it back to the home screen., It would be nice to able to designate one app icon as the "cover" of the folder, but we realize we're nitpicking., Thankfully, you're awarded a fair amount of flexibility for folder organization., You can add as many folders as you like, change the default folder name, and add both related and unrelated apps., Surprisingly, we could even group legacy features like the Weather and Stock applications into a single folder., The process is easy, but we wouldn't say it offers a huge change from the equivalent experience on Android., And really, Apple, we're limited to just 12 apps in one folder?, E-mail and enterprise: The iPhone always has been a functional e-mail machine, but we've never enjoyed switching back and forth among multiple accounts to read new messages., Fortunately, iOS 4 has a new unified in-box that is accessible under the "Mail" option on your home screen., Listed above your individual in-boxes is a new option for "All inboxes," which contains messages from multiple accounts., You can't access individual folders from the universal in-box, but you can delete and move messages., Here again, it works well, but it's not vastly superior to how competing OSes handle the same process., Also, the universal in-box doesn't always sync immediately with the inboxes for individual accounts., Other e-mail changes include the capability to add multiple Exchange accounts, organize e-mails by thread, jump directly to individual in-boxes, resize photos before you send, and open attachments with a preferred app., All are nice, but we'll delve into a couple of our favorites for more detail., E-mails in a thread will now be designated by a small number on the left side of the message header., Clicking the number will take you to a separate screen that lists all relevant messages., It's a nice touch, and we like that you can move or delete messages in the thread., We also like the new option to delete e-mails directly from search results., The iPhone 4's virtual keyboard is unchanged., Worker bees will get options like enhanced data protection, mobile device management, wireless app distribution, support for Exchange 2010, and SSL VPN from Juniper and Cisco., Home screen customization: Unlike the previous three features, this addition was low on our wish list, but Apple's done a decent job rolling it out., Sure, you always could change the standard black background using a third-party app, but iOS 4 adds the native capability to the iPhone and iPod Touch., First, find the "wallpaper" option in the Settings menu and choose either a provided wallpaper or a photo in your camera roll., After making your selection, you'll have the option to set it as the wallpaper for your home screen, the lock screen, or both., Hide Review Next page  
It's all straightforward, but there are a couple troublesome trade-offs., First off, keep in mind that once you ditch the standard black background, there's no way to get it back., You can take a photo of a black wall, the night sky, or a dark room, but that's hardly the same thing., And don't be surprised to find that some of your native wallpapers have been replaced by new options., Apple giveth, and Apple hath taken away., Spell check: The iPhone has long had an autocorrect feature that changes words as you type, but we've never considered it to be completely useful., That's why we're bigger fans of the new spell check feature that notifies you of unrecognized or misspelled words with a red underline., It works when you're composing both e-mails and text messages, and you get a list of suggested corrections., We'd like more suggestions, but that's a small point., Search: iOS 4 offers a few new searching options across various features., First off, when typing a URL in the Safari browser, you'll see not only the URL title of sites you've visited recently, but also the full Web address., That's a nice touch, since you can find the exact Web page that you want., Over in Universal Search, you'll see Web and Wikipedia results with the content stored on the phone., It takes a couple of clicks to get them going, but it's convenient., And finally, you'll now find a search bar for your text messages., It works just like the search option for e-mails., Game Center: Coming "later this year," Game Center will include features like a social gaming network, the ability to invite friends to games, leaderboards and achievements, and the opportunity for "matchmaking" (setting up two people to play)., Connectivity: iOS 4 adds persistent Wi-Fi, which means the iPhone 4 will stay connected to a hot spot even when it's in standby mode., This could have a negative effect on battery life so we'll be watching., With wake-on wireless, the handset promises to wake from standby when it comes in range of a cellular network., It's not something we were asking for, but we'll take it., Lastly, there's now support for using a Bluetooth keyboard., We successfully paired and used an Apple Bluetooth keyboard without any problems., Additional changes: As with previous updates, iOS 4 also brings a selection of smaller features and interface tweaks., Among them are a redesigned calculator icon (the feature is the same), the ability to send apps as gifts, alphanumeric pass codes, bigger font sizes for accessibility, enhanced iPod-out capability, and a redesigned location icon in the Google Maps application (it's an arrow instead of a bull's eye)., You also get a new Birthday Calendar that's accessible under the main calendar app., We're still looking for a specific birthday event field, however., iPod player: With the iPhone 4, Apple continues to show that it positively shines with mobile music and video., This is one area where the company beat its competitors hands down., For the most part, the iPhone 4 iPod player is unchanged, but we were glad to see a few new offerings., There's now a convenient option for creating playlists on the go., We did so in just a couple of steps and added a selection of tunes., What's more, we're always happy when we can do something without going through iTunes., Back in the multitasking menu, you'll find new music player controls and a shortcut for locking the display rotation., To get there, just swipe to the far left., Camera: The iPhone's camera has always been decent, but it's lacked features found on many basic phones., That's why we applaud the 5-megapixel resolution, the new LED flash, and the 5x digital zoom., The handset also has a new backside illuminated sensor, which requires a more-detailed explanation., Check out my colleague Stephen Shankland's blog for a detailed look at the technology., The biggest gain, however, is its ability to record 720p high-definition video at a constant 30 frames per second., The iPhone isn't the first handset to offer this capability, but it delivers on quality., Of course, we'd love more options like a brightness control and color tones, but we doubt that we'll ever get them., The camera now has a digital zoom., The primary camera interface is about the same as the 3GS', with the usual shutter control, camera/camcorder switch, and photo gallery shortcut off to one side., A new flash control activates the LED on the rear face., Thankfully, you can choose from auto or "always-on" modes., Over in the opposite corner is a control for switching between the front and rear cameras., When you're not making FaceTime calls, you can use the front-facing VGA camera for self-portraits., Image quality won't amaze, but that's not surprising considering VGA shooters are hardly the pinnacle of technological development., It is great to be able to take vanity shots, though., We welcome the new camera flash., The shooter also includes changes that came from iOS 4., Our favorite is a 5x zoom for the still camera., When taking a photo, just tap the screen to see the zoom bar., Use your finger to pan in and out, but remember that since this is digital zoom, picture quality will degrade as you zoom in., Also, you now can use the tap-to-focus feature in the still and video cameras., In our tests the camera quality is noticeably improved., We'll start with still photos first., Under most conditions, and particularly when outside in daylight, the iPhone 4 takes beautiful photos., Colors are bright and natural, there was no visible image noise, and our shots were in focus., The bright flash also makes a positive change., As with most LEDs, it can make some images look a tad overblown, but we're just glad that we now can take images in a dark room., We also love that there's no shutter lag like there was with previous iPhones., The camera takes the shot the instant you press the shutter., On then downside, the camera doesn't fare quite as well when indoors under fluorescent lighting., Shots in those conditions had a green circle at the center of the image with yellow tints at the edges., The problem was worse when we photographed a white surface., We'd suggest correcting the issue by adjusting the white balance, but like previous Apple handsets, the iPhone 4 doesn't have such a setting., See our iPhone 4 camera photo gallery for a full series of shots with analysis., The iPhone delivers great photo quality., Video quality also impressed., You'll need to keep the phone steady, but our clips were smooth and free of any pixels or hiccups., It also handles motion quite well, and audio was in sync with the video., And of course, you can cut your videos using the nifty video-editing feature that originated on the iPhone 3GS., Photo gallery: You can organize all images from an event or those that feature a specific friend., For both, however, you'll need to have already used the face-recognition options in iPhoto or Aperture and sync with iTunes., One expected change appears to have vanished, however: when we played with the initial beta version of iOS 4, we saw an option in the gallery for rotating photos, but we can't find it again in the final version., FaceTime: Apple is pushing FaceTime as one of the iPhone 4's most-exciting features., It certainly looked good at the WWDC demo, so we were eager to try it., After even a short test we were pleased with the feature's quality and we like that it's an integrated option that doesn't require an app., The incoming video can be a bit pixelated and jerky, particularly when your friend is using the front camera, but it wasn't bothersome., And really, that's to be expected when using a VGA shooter., You'll see a slightly better feed if your friend uses the rear camera, but not by much., The video from your phone will show in the top left corner; it looked great from either camera., Also, you can use it in both portrait and landscape modes., FaceTime in action., Obviously, FaceTime only works with another iPhone 4., You activate the feature after placing a call on a Wi-Fi network (more on that in a minute)., Once the call connects, you'll see an option for FaceTime instead of the normal "Hold" control (we've no clue where that option went)., Both you and your friend must press the control to establish a video chat; you then can mute the call or end it directly from the FaceTime screen., And after you placed a FaceTime call for the first time, you'll see the phone number listed twice in your recent calls list., One entry will activate FaceTime directly, and the other will place a normal cellular call., That's not to say FaceTime wasn't without its problems., On more than one occasion, we couldn't establish a connection, even though we were using two iPhone 4s on Wi-Fi., From what we can tell, you'll need a very strong Wi-Fi connection in order to use the feature., The switch between normal and FaceTime calls can take a few seconds, during which reception is faulty., Also, we dropped a couple of calls during the switch., We've heard a lot of grumbling about this restriction, but we don't think that's a bad thing., Video chat uses a ton of data so we're sure the experience would be better on Wi-Fi than on AT&T's strained network, anyway., What's also great is that because you're on Wi-Fi, FaceTime calls will not deduct from your cellular minutes., Jobs said Apple is working with iPhone carriers to carry the feature (cue speculation on possible new carriers), but he didn't offer other details., As long as Apple kills the Wi-Fi limit in the next year, we'll be happy., As fun as it is, though, it's not a feature that we were burning for, and we wonder if it will last past the novelty stage., This is not a reflection on the quality of Apple technology--so back off, fanboys--but rather on if users will really use it over the long term., After all, video chat technology has been around since 2004 when AT&T Wireless (remember that?) first debuted a very limited service on the brick-size Motorola A845., The phone didn't last long, but video chat is common around the world and in the United States., AT&T runs its Video Share on a limited number of phones, for example, and Sprint's HTC Evo 4G offers the Qik video chat application., Each has a few drawbacks, but they do exist., Yet, Apple has a talent for repackaging existing features and attracting wide consumer interest., Outside of other VoIP services like the Skype app, carriers have been unsuccessful at making video-calling services popular and useful., FaceTime will face competition from other devices, but Apple could very well make it work., Gyroscope: The iPhone 3Gs gave us a compass, but the iPhone 4 raises the bar by offering a three-axis gyroscope., Like on an airplane, you'll get pitch, roll, and yaw, and it's tied with the accelerometer to provide six-axis motion sensing., Though by all means it will be useful to app and game developers, it was a lot of fun when we used it to play a few games., Tethering: The iPhone has always been capable of tethering, but AT&T has lagged behind other carriers in offering an option for it., In its new pricing plans, however, AT&T now offers the ability to use your iPhone as a modem for your PC., You'll need to pay an extra $20 to get it, but at least it's there., We'll test this feature and report back., iOS 4.1 and 4.2: Apple released iOS 4.1, the first major software update following the iPhone 4's launch, on September 8., It added several new features including high dynamic range photos, support for TV show rentals on iTunes, FaceTime calling directly from Favorites menu in the phone book, and the ability to upload HD videos to YouTube and MobileMe over Wi-Fi on the iPhone 4., And at long last it also turned on Game Center., See our iOS 4.1 hands-on for more analysis with screenshots., The next major updates, iOS 4.2, came November 22, 2010., It didn't add anything groundbreaking, either, but we welcome the additions nonetheless., Now you can search for text on a Safari page, add personalized message tones, set new parental controls, activate FaceTime through the Voice Control feature or the messaging app, print photos over the air, integrate with Apple's AirPlay feature, and choose new fonts for the Notes app., Read more about iOS 4.2 in our hands-on look with the Gold Master edition., iMovie and iBooks: iMovie brings movie-editing capabilities to the iPhone., You'll pay $4.99 for the app, but it's a nice touch., Download.com's Jason Parker put iMovie through its paces in a separate review., Apple's e-book reader joins Amazon's Kindle app as an option for bookworms., You will be able to access Apple's iBookstore to purchase new content, and if you have an iPhone and an iPad, you can read your book on both devices (with just one purchase) and sync your current page., Processor: Under the hood is the same 1GHz ARM Cortex A8 chip that's found in the iPad., Also, though Apple hasn't specified the RAM, we know that it is 512MB., In early tests, the phone is quite a bit faster than the 3GS and certainly than the iPhone 3G., Menus, applications, and other features opened in a flash., And as we mentioned earlier, the app switching in the multitasking menu and the camera shutter didn't leave us waiting., Call quality
Much has been said about problems with AT&T and the iPhone, and even on the iPhone 4 call quality remains the biggest sticking point., Indeed, when we tested the quad-band (GSM 850, 900/1,800/1,900) world phone in San Francisco and Boston, we encountered mixed results, with improvements in some areas, trouble in some areas, and no change in others., On the upside, audio clarity was sharper, our friends' voices sounded natural, and the volume was a tad louder than on previous iPhones., Also, the noise-cancellation mic does a good job of screening out background audio., Even when in a loud place we could continue with our conversations without any problem., What's more, we heard no "side noise" (the sound of our own voice coming back through the phone), static, or interference., iPhone 4 call quality sample
Listen now:, We also noticed a decrease in dead zones that we've typically encountered in San Francisco., In a couple of notoriously troublesome spots, we were able to receive calls when we had no luck with the 3G or the 3GS., Dropped calls were fewer, as well, though we had more failed connections than we'd like., We had decent results when we tested the phone on Cape Cod and rural areas of Massachusetts., In fact, AT&T was more reliable in those places than T-Mobile., Perhaps the antenna made a difference., But then again, perhaps it didn't., Soon after we posted this review we heard from many CNET users who complained that when they held the phone in the hand--a common occurrence, no doubt--the number of bars decreased within a few seconds (see our related video for more information)., The reports came mostly from people who covered the notch on the phone's left side with their palm while holding it in their left hand., Initially we had mixed results in replicating the bars problem, and our experience varied widely by location, the initial signal strength, the phone we were using, and the person using it., At times we saw no difference, but other times we noticed the signal drop from a full five bars down to two or three., When we moved our hand away, the meter jumped back to normal., Though the number of bars isn't the most accurate test of reception, it is the one that most users rely on., Unfortunately, Apple removed the more reliable iPhone Field Test feature from iOS 4., In the iOS 4.1 release, however, Apple wisely added the feature back in., In other areas, our experience was more troubling., During call tests we found that when we touched the antenna gap, the audio quality degraded significantly., We tested three different iPhone 4s in various locations in San Francisco and experienced problems using various hand positions, including one finger on the gap, cradling the handset gently, and holding it tighter with our left hand on either side., In all instances, we made sure not to cover the microphone with our hands., At times our voice cut out completely, whereas on other occasions the audio became garbled., We did not, however, suffer any dropped calls., We also conducted data speed tests using the Speedtest app from Xtreme Labs that showed slower download and upload speeds., Other reviewers and media outlets have reported similar results., Regrettably, Apple's initial response to the issue wasn't satisfying., On June 24, 2010, the first day of iPhone 4 sales, Apple sent the following statement to PC Magazine: "Gripping any phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas., This is a fact of life for every wireless phone., If you ever experience this on your Phone 4, avoid gripping it in the lower left corner in a way that covers both sides of the black strip in the metal band, or simply use one of many available cases." 
Granted, keeping your fingers away from a cell phone antenna is advisable for the best reception, and Apple is hardly the first manufacturer to offer such advice., We see such warnings commonly on handsets that have a bottom-facing antenna, but users typically don't hold such a device with their palm or fingers resting in that area., The iPhone 4, however, is the first phone to the place the antenna in a natural gripping point., The iPhone 4 also differs from other handsets in that its antenna is electrically exposed., Instead of touching a rubber coating, you touch the antenna directly., And when you bridge the gap, your finger appears to interfere with the antenna's efficiency., Honestly, we don't buy the "death grip" theory and we don't like how it unfairly blames the user., There's a difference between holding the phone and squeezing it until you're about to crush it., And more importantly, when we've touched the antenna area on other handsets, like the Motorola i1, the HTC Nexus One, and the Palm Pre, call quality diminished only a minimal amount, if it did so at all., But keep in mind that those devices don't have antennas that are completely exposed., Finally, on July 16, 2010, Apple held an unprecedented press conference where CEO Steve Jobs characterized the issues as being "blown way out of proportion," and denied that the iPhone 4's attenuation issues are worse than any other smartphone's (we've already told you that we disagree with that point)., Though Jobs maintained that only a small number of users are experiencing a problem, Apple is offering all iPhone 4 customers a free case through September 30, 2010., In our testing, an Apple-supplied "bumper" case solves any call quality issues, preventing users from touching the gap in the iPhone's antenna on the left side., You can get a refund if you've already purchased a bumper, but if you're still not satisfied, you can return your phone for a full refund within 30 days., Certainly, we appreciate the free case., We never advocated for an iPhone 4 recall, but we maintain that the exposed antenna causes unique problems., In other words, don't be surprised if next year's iPhone 5 is slightly redesigned., Indeed, most customers should welcome the move given that the bumper solves the attenuation problem, and they no longer have to shell out a galling $29 just to get it., But that doesn't mean Apple is off the hook completely., We shouldn't have to use rubber and plastic bumpers just to get good reception., And we shouldn't have to change the aesthetics of the phone to make a reliable call., On their end, callers said we sounded reasonably good., During calls where we used a bumper, they could hear us without any problems and they mentioned there was less background noise than when we used the 3GS., The first iPhone had a sensitive sweet spot, but we didn't notice that here., A few people heard some interference, but they said it was manageable., Automated calling systems could understand us most of the time, even if we were on a busy street., On the downside, the iPhone 4 appears to still have a problem with hand-offs between EDGE and the 3G network., The handset still tries to hang on to weak 3G signal when it should switch to EDGE., As we said with the iPhone 3GS, the reception jumped if we switched off the handset's 3G radio in the Settings menu., Speakerphone calls were mostly satisfactory., We could hear our friends clearly, though the volume was a tad distorted at the highest levels., You don't need to be close to the phone to hear, but we had to be close to the phone for our friends to hear us., That's not unusual, though., Bluetooth headset performance was mixed., Bluetooth headset calls were fine, but we had mixed issued with stereo Bluetooth headsets., See Nicole Lee's analysis for more information., Performance tests from CNET Labs, Test iPhone 4 HTC Evo 4G   Phone boot time test 29.4 seconds 47.1 seconds   Talk time battery life 3G 7.76 hours 5.5 hours   Audio playback time 59 hours 18.2 hours   Video playback time 6.9 hours 5.9 hours   Browser load speed on Wi-Fi (Giantbomb.com) 15 seconds 20 seconds   Camera app load time 2 seconds 2 seconds   Camera reshoot time 1 second 3 seconds, Data connectivity
The quality of the data connection varied., Given AT&T's throttled network in San Francisco, grahpics-heavy sites like Airliners.net and Wow.com loaded in about 50 seconds, which is longer than on on the other three major carriers., T-Mobile took about 40 seconds to load the same sites, whereas Sprint and Verizon Wireless performed slightly better., What's more, AT&T's 3G doesn't reach as far into buildings or underground in transit stations., As you'd expect, simpler sites or pages built for mobile phones loaded much quicker, often in 15 seconds or less., EDGE browsing is a bit painful, so we suggest using it rarely., Signal strength meter
On July 15, 2010, Apple issued a promised software update that fixed a problem of incorrect signal bars on the display., According to the company, the iPhone 4 was incorrectly showing more bars in areas with weaker signal., See our full analysis of iOS 4.0.1 for more details., Keep in mind that the 4.0.1 update is unrelated to the antenna's reception., Battery life
The iPhone 4's bigger battery should mean more juice to get you through the day., Apple officially promises 14 hours of EDGE talk time, 7 hours of 3G talk time, 40 hours of audio playback, 10 hours of video playback, 6 hours of 3G browsing, 10 hours of Wi-Fi browsing, and 300 hours of standby., In early testing, the battery lasted a respectable period., We used it heavily for about 5 hours and we were still going relatively strong after a full charge., In the following days we were continually pleased., Whereas previous iPhones died after a full day, the iPhone 4 lasted into the next., In tests with CNET Labs, we recorded 14.55 hours of EDGE talk time and 7.76 hours of 3G talk time, thus beating Apple's promises., For audio playback with 3G on, our longest test was 59.02 hours, which also beat Apple's rated time., Yet, the iPhone 4 fell short of Apple's promises for video playback., In our tests, we coaxed only 6.9 hours with of video 3G turned on., According to FCC radiation tests, the iPhone 4 has a digital SAR of 1.17 watts per kilogram., ?|

Where previous iPhones have become iconified as singular slabs, iPhone 4 takes it to the next level ? flat, curved but with an edge, and ? of course ? obsessively thin., That?s 0.37 inches (9.3 mm) thin for the spec fans among us, at 4.5 inches (115.2 mm) high and 2.31 inches (58.6 mm) wide and weighing in at the same 4.8 ounces (137 grams) as the iPhone 3GS., It looks flat out sexy and it feels fine to hold even if Apple has once again made no concessions towards grip ? as we said it?s all stainless steel and glass., Along the sides you?ll find the few, familiar buttons and ports ? 3.5mm headset (still flush), noice-canceling mic, sleep/wake button, microSIM card slot (along the side now), speaker, 30-pin dock connector, phone mic, volume up and down buttons (separate now, not a rocker), and the ring/silent switch., On the front, below the screen (which we?ll get to in a moment) is the home button., Above the screen is the ear speaker and the new front-facing, VGA (640?480) camera., On the back is the new 5 megapixel still, 720p video camera and LED flash., Retina Display

Beneath the front layer of that glass is what Apple is calling Retina Display, a ridiculously dense 960?640 screen resolution., That?s four times as many pixels packed into the same 3.5 inch (88.9 mm) diagonal space as the iPhone 3GS (and every previous iPhone)., At 326 ppi (pixels per inch), it?s higher than the print quality of many color publications and while scientists will debate the exactitude of Apple?s branding to our eyes the only thing that matters is ? no more pixels., We?re not going to get into the debate about whether or not 326 ppi is a truly a retina-exceeding display ? Georgia has covered that debate ? but here?s an attempt to simulate the difference strictly for the purpose of this review., We took similar screenshots with both the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4 and then scaled up the the iPhone 3GS to 200% using ?nearest neighbor? to keep the edges from smoothing., On a 72/96 ppi computer screen the difference will look far more dramatic than it really is but for small details like the icons in a folder or tiny text on a web page, the difference is noticeable., Much like Apple?s design trend has been to minimize the machine and leave only the display as a window into the web and apps, Retina Display takes that even further, it turns the display into a window., The grid is gone and you see only the content., It?s both subtle and profound and you might not notice the difference until the next time you see tiny text on a lesser display., iPhone 4 is simply more like looking at a glossy magazine or analog movie screen that piece of electronics., Like with the recent iMac and the iPad, Apple is using LED with IPS, which are a couple of acronyms that net out to rich colors, deep blacks, and a very wide viewing angle., You can watch movies or read text even if you?re looking at it almost sideways., Previous generations of iPhone held on to the 480?320 display while competing devices went to 800?480 (or 854?480 in the case of the newly announced Droid X), iPhone 4 leapfrogs to the top again., And by making the new 960?640 resolution precisely quadruple the old one, they?ve ensured legacy apps will look exactly the same as on an iPhone 3GS (no iPad style jaggies) and new apps specifically design for iPhone 4 will look significantly sharper., It?s a huge step up from previous iPhones and from any other display currently on the market., The downside to all that glass is that it could scratch, chip, or even break., Dieter?s iPhone 4 somehow suffered a hairline scratch on the first weekend., Since it?s glass on both sides, it also increases the odds that, if you drop it, glass will take the impact., With the display now laminated to the screen, you?ll have to replace the whole assembly if that ever happens., Consider extra insurance or a case or body skin if you?re at all worried., However, the benefit of that lamination is that there is no space at all between the LCD and the outer glass, which makes the display look better and should completely eliminate dust appearing in that space., We should also note there were initial reports of yellow splotches on some screens., This could be the result of the laminate glue not having had time to properly cure., Running the display on high brightness and waiting a couple days is supposed to render it clear., That seems to be the case but we?re going to wait a while before scratching it off our watch list., Cameras

While the iPhone has always had a very popular camera, it would be polite to say it hasn?t always had a very high quality camera., The iPhone 3GS took a step forward with 3 megapixels, tap-to-focus, and much better auto white-balance and imaging software., It was good enough to outperform other camera phone with higher pixel counts but was starting to show its age as Nokia and Android hit the 8mp mark., iPhone 4 shows that Apple is not only making an effort to keep up now, but is actively working to take their camera to another level., Rather than chopping up their sensor even more to join the aforementioned megapixel race, Apple went with a more modest increase to 5mp but increased the size and quality of the sensor, and added back illumination at the same time., That means each pixel is bigger and better at absorbing light which translates into higher quality images, especially at low light., (And they even threw in an LED flash for good measure.)

Here are some photos taken by Dieter and Leanna., See more of Dieter?s photos
See more of Leanna?s photos


It?s not perfect ? whites are sometimes blown out, the 5x digital zoom is still a digital zoom, and it won?t match a high quality point-and-shoot, much less DSLR ? but it?s still amongst the best cameras we?ve seen on a phone to date., That, combined with what seems like even better software and the convenience of convergence means many  people will be leaving their point-and-shoot camera at home., Another product that doesn?t look like it?s long for this world is the Flip Mino HD., iPhone 4?s 720p, 30fps video looks good enough, thanks to the same tap-to-focus and white-balancing software, that anything under a proper 1080p prosumer video camera can mostly be left at home., (Mostly because video recording drains battery and eats up storage, so if you?re planning to shoot a lot on the go you?ll need a way to recharge and to transfer old video off to make room for new.)

Here?s some video Leanna recorded (crushed by YouTube compression, of course, but hit the 720p button for best-we-can-get quality)., And here?s some in low-light with the LED., (It can be turned on and left on for video work)., iPhone 4 also features a front-facing camera., It is considerably smaller than the beast of a lens on the rear, the front-facing camera is intended mainly for VGA quality self-portraits (hello new profile pics!) and video, like for Apple?s new FaceTime feature., (More on that below.)

Stainless steel antenna band

When the first leaked images of iPhone 4 appeared many people doubted they were the real-thing since the black gaps in the otherwise polished steel band around the outside looked so decidedly un-Apple., At WWDC 2010 Steve Jobs revealed that the band was actually the main structural element of the phone ? and an external antenna array., The black gaps were the separations between the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS antenna and the GSM/UTMS cellular radio antenna., While Apple often says great form is functional, seldom do they let functionality trump form to this extent, so we figured it must be important., And it is., Many people report better reception with the iPhone 4? unless they touch it on the lower left side, making a connection between two of those antennas with their hand., It?s not happening to everyone (at TiPb we?re split ? for example Dieter can reproduce it at will, Jeremy doesn?t have it at all) and we don?t yet know how widespread it is or whether it can be fixed by a software update, but ? for a lot of people if you hold iPhone four in your left hand or otherwise create a connection between the two antennas on the left side, the network (voice and/or data) can drop from full bars to none almost immediately., Areas with strong signal, especially outside, seem to have fewer problems than areas with weak signals, especially inside., Apple has, incomprehensibly, suggested users learn to ?hold different? or use a case that insulates the area., Suffice it to say those aren?t acceptable answers, so we?ll just have to wait and see what happens next., Call quality overall is quite good., If you?re not bridging those antennas, reception is markedly better than previous iPhones and dropped calls slightly better., Apple lists the radios as UMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz), GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz), 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi (802.11n 2.4GHz only), and Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR wireless technology., Pentaband cellular is a great addition., Unfortunately, it doesn?t include T-Mobile US 3G, but the extra bands will certainly be appreciated by networks in the Asia-Pacific areas that use them., Likewise, fast, far reaching 802.11n is an appreciable upgrade somewhat crippled by being restricted to the more congested 2.4GHz frequency., Most 802.11n routers give the roomier 5GHz range as an option., It?s too bad Apple didn?t do the same., Speaker and mics

For a company whose heritage is the iPod, the iPhone has never blown us away with its speakers., They?ve lacked loudness to the degree that some users took needles to previous models in desperate attempt to get the sound out., (We didn?t recommend it, still don?t.)

We?re glad to report that iPhone 4 sounds better and louder to us., The speaker phone, while still not booming, is far more usable than any of its predecessors., The ear speaker also seems louder and make stereo gaming a noticeably more enjoyable experience., It is worth noting that the speaker is still recessed on the bottom and so holding the iPhone in a natural position for games ? which is to say horizontally ? can cause the speaker to be almost entirely muffled by your hand., Noise cancellation is very, very impressive, the best we?ve heard on any phone or Bluetooth headset., Even with very loud music in the background, callers report that they can hear us loud and clear., Unfortunately, performance with Bluetooth headsets and Bluetooth car stereos lags behind other phones ? sound quality is slightly robotic., Internals

Apple has considerably beefed up iPhone 4?s internal specs, most notably by including the ARM Cortex A8 and PowerVR SGX-based Apple A4 system-on-a-chip that debuted in the iPad., It?s unclear whether or not the iPhone 4?s A4 is clocked at the same 1GHz as the iPad?s, whether its under-clocked to save on power and reduce thermal output, or whether it can dynamically adjust its speed to strike a balance between demands and constraints., Apple?s not saying and for most of us none of that really matters., It feels snappy and transitions with a silky smoothness that trumps the already impressive iPhone 3GS and gives the much larger iPad a run for its money ? both in performance and battery life., Using both the A4 and the smaller microSIM standard, Apple has made the battery 14% bigger and made some aggressive claims as to just how long and how hard you can push your iPhone 4: up to 7 hours talk time on 3G, 14 hours on 2G, and 300 hours on standby., Internet is rated at 6 hours on 3G and 10 hours on Wi-Fi., Video playback is said to match the iPad?s 10 hours (!) while audio reaches 40 hours., We?ve only had the iPhone 4 in our power hungry hands for a couple of days now and battery life can fluctuate especially when you?re dealing with a new device., That said, in our decidedly unscientific tests it lasted longer than our iPhone 3GS and we?ll be putting it through its paces to see just how well it holds up over the days, weeks, and months ahead., (And we?ll update with our findings)., Something Apple didn?t mention but tear downs have subsequently and joyously revealed are 512MB of RAM., That?s double the iPhone 3GS and double the iPad, and something that should really pay off in terms of the new display and most importantly, the new multitasking., Recent Android and Windows Phone devices have had 1GHz Snapdragon chips in them for a while now, and 512MB of RAM has become the new high-end standard., It?s nice to see Apple matching those on spec and it will be interesting to see what if any advantage composing their own Systen-on-a-Chip gives them moving forward., There?s also a new sensor in the mix this year., A gyroscope ? the first in a phone as far as we?re aware ? hooks into the accelerometer and allows for incredibly precise 3-axis motion control and rotation around gravity., That translates into better games, better augmented reality., Not a lot of apps are making use of the gyroscope yet but in the couple we tried it took the kinda-sorta feeling of the accelerometer and made it the yes-exactly feeling of real control., Accessory compatibility

While iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS shared the same casing, meaning accessory manufacturers had an incredible 2 year run using the same basic templates for their designs, iPhone 4 is a different beast., If you have accessories from a previous iPhone, and those accessories were molded (typically cases, some chargers, and docks) chances are they won?t fit properly on or with iPhone 4., You?ll have to look into the new ones that are already coming to market., If they?re designed to fit in the 30-pin Dock connector, iPhone 4 should pop up a warning if it thinks they aren?t compatible., The warning isn?t always a show-stopper ?  our car charger said it was incompatible but charged just fine ? but it?s something to consider., If you?re uncertain, proceed with caution., And if you?re wondering ? no, Apple iPad camera kit isn?t currently supported by iPhone 4., It would sure be nice if Apple added that little bit of functionality., The total package

Taken as a whole Apple has produced what can only be described as a stunningly beautiful piece of industrial design that may or may not be tragically flawed by what first seemed a very clever part of that design., An even more singular experience than previous iPhones, we?ll likewise have to wait and see just how much Apple?s penchant for the minimalism of glass and metal costs iPhone 4 when it comes to durability., Software

iPhone 4 ships with iOS 4, the fourth ? and freshly renamed ? annual update to Apple?s mobile operating system., Aside from FaceTime and iPhone 4-specific functionality like LED flash control, Retina Display, and gyroscope support, we?ve documented the features extensively already in our iOS 4 walkthrough., So we?re going to focus here not so much on the facts but on the feeling ? what are the key new iOS 4 software features like to use on iPhone 4?, For comparative context, here?s what it looks like on iPhone 3GS., YouTube link

FaceTime

Apple didn?t invent video calls to be sure., Nokia has been doing it for a while and HTC?s recently released, Android-powered Sprint Evo 4G does it by means of third party software like Qik., FaceTime, by contrast, is typically Apple in that it?s a first party, end-to-end solution., That makes it both easier to use than previous attempts but also far more limited., You place a call or pick a contact, hit the FaceTime button, and you?re video calling? provided the other person in also on an iPhone 4 and on Wi-Fi., (Apple thinks they may get carrier support for cell data FaceTime next year.)

Frustratingly, if the person you want to FaceTime isn?t on an iPhone 4, isn?t on Wi-Fi, or just isn?t ready for you, FaceTime won?t indicate this in advance, it will just try to connect? and try to connect? until it fails., When it works, though, it works great., Your own picture sits in the corner but can be moved with the flick of a finger, and a single tap can switch it from front-facing to rear-facing camera so the person you?re talking to can share not only the conversation, but the action., If you want to put the call on hold, tap and hold the mute button., If you want to temporarily stop the video but keep the audio going, tap the home button to put FaceTim into the background., Here?s Chad and Leanna trying it out., If you want to try it out as well and don?t have another iPhone 4 wielding, Wi-Fi connected friend handy, Apple has customer support specialists available to try it with you at 1-888-FACETIME., Apple built FaceTime on open protocols like the  H.264 video codec, AAC audio codec, SIP signaling protocol, STUN and ICE for NAT traversal, TURN for TCP/UDP data receipt, RTP and SRTP for audio and video packet delivery., Interestingly they?ve released their implementation back as an open protocol so that others can use it as well., Hopefully some, like Apple?s own iChat on Mac, and Skype on pretty much every platform will adopt it., Yes, in the not-so-distant future we might just be able to pick up FaceTime on iPhone 4 and talk to our fellow editors at Android Central and Nokia Experts on their devices., It remains to be seen if video calling can be made mainstream, but given their record lately, we won?t bet against Apple., Multitasking

The iPhone has always multitasked and multitasked well, it?s just been limited to Apple?s own apps like iPod and Mail., They haven?t allowed 3rd party App Store apps to run in the background until now., We?ve written quite a bit already about iOS 4?s implementation of multitasking from a how-it-works perspective, and at WWDC we heard from many developers who sounded really impressed by it in theory., Now we?ve had a chance to feel it in action and? it?s a mixed bag., It?s not as well visualized as Palm webOS? Cards metaphor or as open as Windows Mobile 6.5?s run-until-you-get-killed system., It?s actually closer to but more limited than Android?s model., If you?re not hip to how Apple is providing background access ? and why should an end user be?, ? some things working and others not could come off as confusing., Here?s the gist ? if an app is running and you hit the home button, it no longer quits but is allowed to register a thread to complete a task (like uploading a photo to YouTube) or leave a VoIp connection (like Skype), music stream (like Pandora), or location-based service (like TomTom or FourSquare)., Apps can also register local notifications, like push notifications but without requiring an internet server to send them (so your clock could sleep but your alarm would still go off)., The rest of the app then saves its state and closes down to conserve resources like memory and battery power., Users can then double-tap the home button to get a new, fast app switcher UI to quickly move around, and when they come back to the original app they were running, it reloads the saved state and they can continue from exactly where they left off., Developers, however, have to implement things like saved state and the background music API, and while Apple is listing iOS 4 compatible apps in the App Store, those simply indicate apps that have been tested and don?t crash under iOS 4, not apps that properly implement multitasking., This means a user could have one app, like the excellent Real Racing, which does save state, and another app, like Eliminate: Gun Range, which currently supports Retina Display and the gyroscope but does not save state (at least in our tests), creating a confusing experience and the perception that iOS 4 multitasking is buggy at best and broken at worst., Apple should really save the Awesome iOS 4 Apps badge for apps that awesomely implement iOS 4 features, not just pass the crash test., The background API for streaming music is solid., We?ve streamed iTunes podcasts, switched to other streams, done hard reboots twice, and the stream has still picked up right where we left off., TomTom is currently the only big name supporting background location for turn-by-turn but we?ve seen beta versions of some of the others and they all worked well ? clear directions even while out of the app or on a call, and quick resumption when back in the app., Skype is still looking into background support and since it took them 3 months to get 3G support out the door, we?re not holding our breath for a quick update., Please.)

Beyond background VoIP, streaming music, and location, however, other useful background API aren?t currently supported., Time-line updates specifically is something Apple said they?re supporting via notifications rather than background., That means you?ll know if you get a new tweet, IM, or RSS article because of a badge, sound, or alert box, but the app will still have to load that new content when you re-launch it (unlike iPhone?s Mail app which gets your email in the background and has the subject and preview ready and waiting when you tap into it.)

Persistent internet connections for things like SSH tunnels and VNC sessions aren?t supported., You can complete tasks after you exit but they?ll have to reconnect when you go back to them later., For the sake of communication junkies and network administrators both, here?s hoping Apple expands background support to include them in the future., In terms of the fast-app switcher interface, this is the part that most of us will simply consider the new ?multitasking? since it?s the most visible element., While again not as slick as Palm?s Cards (which, to be fair, is similar to Apple?s interface for switching pages in mobile Safari), it does stick closely to the overall app and dock-centric metaphor Apple?s been training us on since iOS 1.0., A lot of work has been done to preserve our orientation., When you double click the home button the screen looks to split open and reveal the new interface ?in the background?., Apps are sorted by most recent use, eliminating the previously annoying need to page through up to 11 home screen pages just to switch back and forth between two apps., When you change apps via the multitasking UI, you get a new animation, like a carousel, that shows the new app coming in on top and pushing the old app into the background., (If you exit to the home screen first you get the traditional, iconic, fly-in/fly-out animation)., Since apps are supposed to save state now, and you come back right where you left off, the overall experience really is quick and clean ? and perceptively multitasking., The multitasking dock also has a few other features., You can force-quit an app here by going into jiggly mode and tapping the minus icon., If you swipe left on the multitasking UI you get a set of pseudo widget-like controls., Strangely, it?s portrait-only at the moment but for those who like to read in bed, half a solution is better than none., The next three controls are for streaming music ? skip back/rewind, play/pause, and skip ahead/fast forward., The last icon is for the app that?s currently playing music, either iPod for local music, iTunes for streaming podcasts from the store, or Pandora, Slacker, etc., Nifty as that is, there?s still no lock screen or home screen widgets to provide glance-able data (aside from Calendar, whose icon carries the current date ? something it?s done since iPhone 1.0 but no other icon has been updated to do since)., Overall, iOS 4?s fast app switcher is familiar enough and contextual enough that the added complexity isn?t overwhelming., It feels like it works the way it should, just not quite yet the way the power users among us wish it would., Ultimately, while it?s easy to nit, it?s hard to argue with Apple?s results here ? there?s a system that does most of what we think multitasking should do with minimal impact on battery life or performance., That?s a huge win., Folders

You could previously store 180 apps on your iPhone., Thanks to iOS 4 you can now create an app ?folder? that contains up to 12 other apps, bringing the theoretical total to 2160., The folder icon itself will display tiny versions of the apps inside it, which are surprisingly recognizable on iPhone 4?s Retina Display., However, folder icons only show 9 app icons (3?3) out of twelve, meaning apps 10 through 12 are effectively hidden, destroying the entire purpose of icons., Then again, some folks are already saying 12 apps per folder isn?t enough so limiting it to 9 probably would have come with complaints as many if not more complaints., Visually the folder UI is similar to the fast app switcher in that it splits the screen and ?opens? up to reveal the apps contained inside (orientation and context)., You create or add to a folder by dragging one app icon onto another, you remove apps or folders by dragging apps out, and when no apps are left the folder automatically deletes itself., Folders are named ?intelligently? according to Apple, which means they check the app category and sub-category and try to match whichever is both most specific and most applicable to the group., ?Social? would show up for Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn apps., A bunch of FPS would get ?Action Games?, etc., Given most of us will group similar apps together, it usually works fairly well and when it doesn?t it?s easy to edit., Again, it?s nothing like a hierarchical file system like you?d find in older PalmOS or Windows Phone devices, and it provides no functionality beyond simple grouping., For many of us, that?ll be enough., Mail

There are two big changes to mail, support for multiple ActiveSync accounts (so you can push both your work Exchange and home Gmail/Google Sync at the same time), and unified inbox with threaded email view., Multiple ActiveSync works well to the point that you don?t realize it?s there ? just set it up and you?re good to go., Pushing MobileMe, Exchange, and Google Sync didn?t cause an appreciable hit on our battery life either., The unified inbox and threaded email work well enough, though sometimes we had to dig through threads to find new mail., (That could have been the result of Google?s mail service performing very poorly in general during the period we were testing)., When multiple messages are in a thread a small gray square containing the number of messages is displayed beside a small gray arrow to the right hand side., Tapping a message takes you to the thread view, tapping it again shows you the message., This does mean Apple has doubled the amount of taps needed to get to an email, but if that bothers you, you can hop into Settings, Mail, Contacts, and Calendar, and flip the Organize by Thread toggle to ?off?., Not as well oriented or contextualized an interface as the fast app switcher or folders, it?s none-the-less one more tiny little step on Apple?s journey towards serious communications device., Next steps will hopefully include adding the ability to mark (and mark all) as read/un-read, and flag/star messages., iBooks and iMovie

Apple announced two apps alongside iPhone 4., The first was iBooks for iPhone, the second was iMovie for iPhone 4., These aren?t built in, however, but made available via the iTunes App Store., (Which hopefully means Apple can update them at their own pace and not be forced to tie their updates to iOS releases like the built in apps ? a considerably longer cycle)., Here?s Chad?s video on iBooks for iPhone 4., Here?s Leanna?s video on iMovie for iPhone 4., For more, check out her iMovie for iPhone 4 hands-on., iBooks is free and works on all iPhones and iPod touches., iMovie is $4.99 and currently only works on iPhone 4 with its faster processor and higher RAM., We tend to define legacy as lack of support for older generation devices and fragmentation as lack of support for current generation devices (due to different hardware specs or operating system availabilities)., Things like the Retina Display being exactly 4x the size of previous displays, and API like CoreMotion and CoreLocation abstracting away the lack of gyroscopes and GPS on older devices, Apple is falling victim to legacy but doing a lot o avoid fragmentation., We?ll see how long they can keep that up, and how widely they can spread iOS to devices like iPad before it becomes a problem to developers and users., Hundreds of thousands of other apps

As we mentioned in the Retina Display section, existing iPhone apps and games will look the same on the iPhone 4 as they do on the iPhone 3GS and previous models., That means there?s already 225,000 apps and games (and likely more by the time we finish writing this) ready to go on your iPhone, a percentage of which are good and a number of which are great., New apps and games that include x2 artwork will look four times as good., Those are growing in number daily and hopefully we?ll see others that start to work with the gyroscope and even FaceTime protocols., Ally is posting roundups of some of our favorite iOS 4 and iPhone 4 games and apps as they go live in the App Store and Apple is maintaining a list of iOS 4 apps they find awesome [iTunes list]., WebOS is making strides in 3D gaming and the Android Market is growing by leaps and bounds., With App Stores in 100 countries, roughly 100 million broadly compatible iOS devices sold to date, and 1 billion paid out to developers, however, Apple maintains a strong lead when it comes to apps and games., That?s good for them, developers, and iPhone users ? due to the large number of apps, there?s a better chance you?ll find the few that are great for you and your needs., That?s the advantage of popularity and scale., Heading into its third year in operation, however, the problem of opaque and inconsistent App Store curation remains., Steve Jobs has said 95% of apps get approved in 7 days, and the 3 top reasons for rejection are apps that don?t do what they say they do, apps that crash on launch, and apps that use private API (that could break in the next OS update)., The price of exerting editorial control, though, is editorial responsibility., Jobs chose to point out app reviewers (and Apple) were just people, and they make mistakes, and can?t foresee everything in advance ? like a rule against defamation conflicting with apps making fair parody of public figures., It?s not that Apple is making mistakes (they are), its not that Apple is learning and improving (they are), it?s that they continue to do so in a black box using editorial ambiguity to shield them from the responsibility mandated by their control., Accessibility

We?re going to quote this from our iOS 4 walkthrough verbatim because it bears repeating., Apple really doesn?t get enough credit for the outstanding accessibility features they build into their OS, both desktop and mobile., iOS 4 continues to lead the industry., VoiceOver supports 21 languages to read out loud whatever your finger touches on the screen, and a Rotor gesture lets you temporarily change languages now on the fly., Bluetooth support has been extended to more than 30 braille devices with tables for more than 25 languages., Touch Typing lets you run your finger across the keyboard, hear the letter you?re currently over, and release your finger to type it., The basic rotor has been made visible so sighted users can see it in action, and you can now add custom settings to move through content., It?s outstanding., We hope other OS choose this as an area to focus their competitive innovations on, and we hope Apple keeps on improving it at the same time., Maturing platform

Apple has gotten to the point with iOS where updates are increasingly about filling out the feature set, which is a good sign of the platforms growing maturity., They?ll have to be careful, however, that with things like fast app switching and folders they?re not increasing complexityor stretching their app launcher-centric UI model too far., The line they?ve successfully walked in the past was to make simple, mainstream features obvious or easily discoverable ? like tapping an icon or swiping a page., For more advanced or niche features Apple didn?t even explain them, just buried them in tech notes or left users to find out about them on sites such as TiPb ? like taking a screenshot or force quitting apps., Fast app switching and folders could fall into the same model, there for those who want to use them, ignorable for those who don?t., It?s closer to the line but we don?t think they?ve crossed it yet, at least not for most users., Pricing and Availability

iPhone 4 became available in the US, France, Germany, the UK, and Japan on June 24, 2010., It?s scheduled to become available Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada (!), Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, and Switzerland in July, though recent Apple website updates have replaced that with the more nebulous ?soon?., All told, Apple plans to ship iPhone 4 to 88 countries this year, a fairly impressive international rollout., True to form, Apple hasn?t reduced the price of the iPhone but gives you more for the same price as last year., Subsidized on AT&T, iPhone 4 will set you back $199 for the 16GB model and $299 for 32GB., ( iPhone 3GS has a new 8GB model and is now occupying the $99 spot)., Outside the US iPhone 4 is or will be available SIM-free (unlocked) if you?re willing to pay full price for it (full price varies by region but should be somewhere north of $600 for 16GB and $700 for 32GB)., iPhone comes in black and white (which this year includes a full white face-plate), but as of this writing the white model has been delayed, something Apple ascribes to a more difficult manufacturing processes., Conclusion

Apple says iPhone 4 is the biggest update since the original iPhone., But it?s a very different market now., Back then the iPhone 2G was a wake up call to an arrogant, complacent establishment that had forgotten the innovation that created their industry., Now the giants have all awakened and new giants have joined them and it will be difficult for anyone to shake things up again the way Apple did in 2007., It?s not that Apple isn?t moving quickly any more, it?s that the initial acceleration is done and everyone else isn?t stationary around them any more ? they?re racing just as fast., Last year we said the iPhone 3GS was more of a step forward than a leap., This year they took a giant hop approaching a skip, and still in the right direction., There?s a lot we still don?t have, like Wi-Fi sync/sharing, and an elegant, non-interuptive notification system., But that list continues to grow shorter and shorter., (And hey, the iOS 5 sneak preview event is only 8 or so months away?)

An impressive new design, amazing new display, key features like multitasking, and an attempt to mainstream video calls, along with hundreds of other little improvements combine together to make this a substantial upgrade and clearly the best iPhone ever., (Given the success of previous iPhones, that?s no faint praise)., Our usual Smartphone Experts advice still holds true ? pick your network first., If AT&T is the best carrier in your area it?s almost a no brainer., Unless you?re allergic to apples, this is the phone to get., Internationally, iPhone 4 will be on multiple carriers in most countries so the odds are good you?ll find it on your carrier of choice (and be able to get it SIM-free, unlocked directly from Apple)., Then it comes down to device., iPhone 4 is still limited in ways that frustrate power users, and may be flawed to the point of having serious issues (we?re waiting to see about that), so that?s something you?ll want to consider before buying., If you currently have an iPhone it?s certainly more compelling an upgrade from the iPhone 3GS than the iPhone 3GS was from the iPhone 3G, and a great cross-grade for anyone on another platform whose willing to sacrifice control to gain usability., If you have an iPhone 3G or iPhone 2G, and you can afford the upgrade, do it., You?ll find the difference is night and day., 139 Responses to ?iPhone 4 Review?, Leave a Reply

I co-sign Don?s comment., And can I have some of that basil??, Yes, I upgraded, but gave the new one to my wife, and unlocked her old one to use as a data WiFi only/ cell phone for me at work (saves the 30 bucks iPhone charge)., Of course I am always ?fiddling? with hers when I am home driving her nuts!!, The only thing I haven?t done yet is download iMovie and tried the video editing, but I am satisfied with the HD video and audio shot with the phone., I still am ?unchartered? on Face Talk as well., 6Roger Nelson`August 9, 2010 at 2:38 pm

It is true what those psychologists say., Apple buyers/fans DO suffer from the Stockholm syndrome., You aren?t capable of finding one single fault, because the second you kind?a find one you shuffle it under the carpet with comments like ?I?m sure everyone is sick of hearing about this issue by now anyway? (as if that makes the issue disappear), ?I?ve had this with any and all GSM phones that I?ve ever used? (yeah, sure and the rest of the complainers are plain stupid, huh?) of the best one, ?I am not going to blame the iPhone for these problems though because I think it?s more of a local carrier issue?., Hahaha, as if Apple had no say in closing an exclusive deal with that same carrier., Steve Jobs is as much a victim as the millions suffering from AT&T?s bad network., I wonder if you would not blame Delta Airlines for losing your luggage, because they outsourced their baggage handling to a third party., If you want to be taken seriously as a reviewer, than you should take off those apple shaped glasses before you do a next review., PS: For example, no word about Apple imposed censorship on applications in their app store?, Or they way they handle the antenna issue?, ?Oh, it doesn?t exit., It?s a software problem., Oh noooo, you guys are holding the phone all wrong!, Okay, okay, we?ll give you free casings?.?

Great review, as always., I am waiting for the white one., In the meanwhile I am dealing with annoyance of loading OS4 on  my 3G., It is so frustratingly slow and freezes a million times., No resetting works., Hope Apple listens to the customers and issues some firmware upgrade., Sorry, but in Julie?s defense, the antennaegate issue is a non issue ., I tried on one to get the bars to drop w/o a case on it (I always use a case anyway, but tried) and I couldn?t duplicate the problem ., maybe I hold it like Steve says is ?the right way??, LOL

@Roger I appreciate all your comments and can see where you?re coming from., But here?s the deal? I purchased the original iPhone, and then the iPhone 3GS., I?ve complained about both of them over the years., I have not used the iPhone exclusively., I switch back and forth between different phones pretty often, but come back to the iPhone because I enjoy using it, warts and all., I purchased the Nexus One and used it for awhile before I hopped back to the iPhone., I am lucky to be able to use pretty much any phone I want, but I keep coming back to the iPhone., So for me, it works., Like Don, I have not suffered from the antenna issue., I see the bars go up and down, but I?ve always seen the bars go up and down., That?s NOTHING new., But like I?ve said in the review, I?ve not had one single dropped call with this phone., And as far as complaining about the way that Apple handles their app store, it?s their prerogative to do so and anyone that buys an iPhone knows what they are signing up for., If you don?t want to deal with a censored app store then either don?t get the iPhone, or jailbreak it and use the alternative app stores., It?s simple., If I had to sum up the main reasons why I like using the iPhone over other phones, it?s the apps, display and the camera (in that order)., As of 2 weeks ago, those reasons have been 100% true for me., Things have changed though? but that?s going to be another article that I?ll be posting in the next day or so., 11Claude DoggettAugust 9, 2010 at 5:35 pm

I bought an iphone 4 the first day it was available., I have had no problems with either at&t or the iphone., I am suspicious of nay sayers who obviously dislike apple in general., Their options are clear., But millions are voting with their feet and choosing the iphone., 12kyptikAugust 9, 2010 at 6:11 pm

Sadly, Apple let me down with this one., I just didn?t feel compelled to upgrade from my 32GB 3GS., The Facetime would be useless to me, as I don?t know anyone else with the iPhone 4, and the processor bump just wasn?t enough to push me over the edge., Had they put 64GB of memory in it, I would have bought it., Instead, I purchased the HTC Incredible to ride alongside my iPhone., The iPhone will still be my primary, but when I get into a poor reception/data area, I?ll have the Droid to fall back on., Plus, now I have a new operating system to play with., As a gadget geek, I?m now in heaven, with the best of both worlds., 13Wayne2626August 9, 2010 at 7:10 pm

Where I am verizon is the dropped calls it all depends on where you live and it is ashame that 3 city speak for the intire Posted by: eldub | 08/7/10 | 1:27 pm |
From my perspective, I look at Apple?s history as a victory in providing the world with exquisitely-designed, life-changing tools., If the rest of the world is willing (or forced) to settle for commoditized products that are less than that, that?s sad, but for me enjoying Apple?s products has made my life a happier journey., the new load and it my take up to 3 years to get a tower aproved and the iPhone has only been out 4 three years., I think the problems will go away in those city., 14DuaneAugust 9, 2010 at 9:06 pm

Overall, good review., I bought the 3G in July 2007 when it came out, never upgraded to the 3GS, but pre-ordered the iPhone 4 and got it on 23 July, the day before release (that was way cool)., Mine DID suffer from the death grip., When I held the phone normally, like I have with the 3G for over two years, I watched the antenna bars drop from 4-5 to 1, and without releasing the grip, clicked on inbox or any other app and it wouldn?t download, it would just search., That was my only issue with the phone., So, I returned it just before my 30 days were up ? after the Steve Jobs video where he said there wasn?t a problem, but if people want a free case, let?s give them a free case., The arrogance is definitely palpable., But having said all that, I am hopeful that Apple fixes the problem because I plan to purchase the next one where this isn?t an issue., My friends, other iPhone users swore there?s didn?t have the same problem, but when I showed them that while you?re holding the phone and try to click on an app, it doesn?t download until you release it., It really isn?t scientific and I am no tech geek., Lastly, I would have about 3 dropped calls in a 30-minute conversation., I?ve always had problems w/dropped calls w/my 3G, but the iPhone 4 is worse., Like I said, I returned mine and re-activated my 3G and continue using it, but I have YET to find another iPhone user that returned one., And like Julie and other?s have said, with Apple there isn?t any surprises ? for the most part, people know what they?re getting into and the iPhone is cooler than any other phone that ?I?ve? seen., Who knows, maybe I?ll find someone with the Droid X and I?ll think that their phone is cool too ? but I hear stories about the battery not lasting more than a few hours and the phone getting so hot that you want to put it down., 15Ken SAugust 9, 2010 at 9:50 pm

One thing users should always be warned about is that the Apps sold in Apple?s App Store (or Cydia for that matter) are NOT safe from viruses/trojan horses., Be careful with what you install and consider downloading the firewall app available in the Cydia store., 16MaxxAugust 10, 2010 at 1:12 am

It?s amazing to me how the ?apple haters? and the droid fan boys are stuck on the antenna issue, I have an i4, and not once have I experienced any dropped calls., It?s 100% to do with how good AT&T is in it area.., N btw I live in san Diego, California., Without using an i4, you talk about antenna issues.., That?s cute., Don?t get mad cos you?ll never experience hd like how all is iPhone 4 users are experiencing., See you would have a valid point if u compared a non jailbroken iPhone 4 to the droid x or the hero., But my phones jailbroken.., I get everything the droid people get, except my video and photo qualities are much higher.., AND I get video calls and oh btw thru jailbreaking I can make video calls over 3G., So good luck with hating droid fan boys, maybe your the one that needs to hop off the droid, and open your eyes?, 17MarkAugust 10, 2010 at 1:50 am

Good review, I?ve updated to from the 3gs to the 4., When I first got the 3gs it was like a breath of fresh air, after 4 years of working in mobile phone retail it was a world apart from what motorola, nokia, sony ericsson, etc could offer., Now there is a lot more choice for us consumers., I was tempted to do for the HTC desire, I kind of regret not going for it as I?m usually one for changing and trying out different tech., I guess what stopped me was the money invested in iphone apps and accessories., I do like the new display and design of the iphone, the OS update was ok, would be nice to have more customization (without having to jailbreak) other than just changing the background., Not sure if I?ll last two years without getting bored of this phone, still, it?ll hold a good price so can trade it in when I do., 19Simon LongAugust 10, 2010 at 6:20 am

Bought my iPhone 4 as a preorder and have had it from day 1., No problems at all with dropped calls or weak signal ? it?s certainly no worse than my iPhone 3GS was in weak signal areas., Antennagate is a complete non-issue as far as I can see., I do get around twice the battery life on the iPhone 4 that I did on the 3GS ? I can easily go three or four days between charges on the iPhone 4, and I was lucky to get two days out of the 3GS., Screen and camera are both useful upgrades over the 3GS, and I much prefer the styling of the 4 to the 3GS, which I thought was a step back from the original iPhone design., The best smartphone I?ve owned ? and I?ve had a lot of them!, 20willAugust 10, 2010 at 7:03 am

Nice, review in my opinion the iphone 4 is just a splendid looking piece of kit., It?s so sleek and hi tech looking., It?s a shame about the deathgrip problem thankfully i?m right handed and don?t use it in my left hand much, kinda lucky i guess., 21iPhone 4 wettbwerbAugust 10, 2010 at 11:44 am

I think it is just sad that it is so complicated to get the free iphone 4 case., With this antenna problems there should be free cases avaiable at every store that sells iphones., 22Bob DeloydAugust 10, 2010 at 12:01 pm

Just upgraded from iPhone 3g to 4?worth the money IMHO!, 25AndieAugust 10, 2010 at 4:53 pm

I live in Australia where the iPhone 4 was released on July 30., I, of course, bought it on day 1., The great thing about getting one here is choice., All the major telcos have the iPhone on their network and you can pick and choose to suit., So coverage for me hasn?t been an issue at all ? neither has ?antennagate?., I have the phone mainly for movies, music, games & apps ? all excel on the iPhone 4., I never heard the phrase ?retina display? before this phone came out, but I can tell you one thing?my retinas are in love with this phone!, 26justinAugust 10, 2010 at 8:26 pm

I had an iphone 3GS and in order to get the iphone 4.0, I had to pay the additional surcharge of $200, making the total come to $504.00 for a 16 gig iphone 4., So I went and did just that last month., I really liked: the gorgeous screen and the movies and photos it took., I loved how quickly and responsive the internet was in comparison to my 3GS., I did not like: how I experienced so many more dropped calls either with out without a bumper., With my 3GS, I rarely had a dropped call and with the iphone 4, I had more in half a day than I had experienced in 2 months with my 3GS., Bottom Line: I returned it and am happy with my 3GS once again., For $504.00, I expected more than I got from the iphone 4 for that much money., I am eagerly awaiting the iphone 5 and then I won?t have to pay a surcharge and know that Apple usually learns from their experiences so that the iphone 5 will be spectacular., In the meantime, I continue to really enjoy my 32 gig iphone 3GS and the great phone reception that I get., No, I?m not an Apple hater or basher., I?m not jealous at their success., Not in any way and the fact that I have (and have had) iPods, iTouches and even an iPhone should be sufficient proof., I tend to buy my gadgets based on my needs and reviews., I don?t subscribe to a brand or ? even worse ? worship it to such a point that I get defensive with any single criticism., My point is in my opening line., I see and know many Apple buyers, but a lot of them convert from buyer to follower., It?s a strange phenomenon where consumers become religious followers., And now even reviewers of respected tech sites!, Undoubtely it is a great phone and I already ordered mine., But keep it real!, My point is that you, as a reviewer (!) ?defend? the few negative points you find., You shouldn?t!, unless you?re not an independent reviewer., You should simply point out that the reception has issues (As by now confirmed by Apple, Don!), that FaceTime is nothing new (as almost every smart-phone over the last 3 years came with a front facing camera and video-calling., At least outside the US) and that the bad network quality is also for a large part the responsibility of Apple., They DID sign that exclusive deal., On the other side of the pond (Netherlands in my case), we are stuck with the same issue., Apple signed an exclusive contract with T-Mobile, but T-Mobile?s network cannot handle the load., I blame them both for not doing their homework and providing what THEY promise!, 28ValconAugust 11, 2010 at 2:39 am

The bad reception is partly a design flaw of the iPhone 4, it?s as simple as that., Bad network quality contributes to that problem, off course., Some people will experience problems, and some will not., For me however, there are plenty of other reasons why not to buy an iPhone:
- closed platform with only one official source of (heavily censored!!) software
- no compliant USB connector (only proprietary)
- no (micro)SD slot
- no hardware keyboard
- no real multitasking
- no real file system
And that?s a shame, because the hardware design and the GUI are absolutely fabulous., So I?m hoping the Samsung Galaxy Q will combine the best iPhone assets with the above mentioned missing assets., @Roger: the iPhone isn?t exclusive to T-Mobile anymore (only the iPhone 4, for now)., You can also buy it with a Vodafone of KPN contract., 29Matt McPAugust 11, 2010 at 10:46 am

@roger
Give it a rest will you, this argument is on pretty much every iphone article/blog on the internet., There are plenty of people who like products and stick to particular brands, whether it?s tech, clothing or whatever., It?s their preference, just let it go and lighten up?., 30Roger NelsonAugust 11, 2010 at 12:08 pm

@Valcon
Yes, you are right., I could get the 3Gs with Vodafone or KPN., I?ve always really enjoyed left-overs., Just recently I bought Michael Jacksons ?Thriller? album (vinyl, of course) at a really good price and listened to it for the first time in my life., I think there are a few songs on it with some hit potential., What do you think?, Come on, man!, This is about having the nicest and newest gadget!, You know as well as I do, that we?re not discussing old phones here., 31IvyAugust 11, 2010 at 1:49 pm

7 days into owning an iPhone 4, I have already run into several problems., Pandora can only be used 3-5 minutes at a time because the speaker begins to crackel and then go silent., I must resart the phone to get it working again., The screen, and no not the yellow spots, but it has been blinking and going black., I have contacted AT&T and I was told to contact Apple., Apple tells me I must send my phone away and it will take 3-5 business days  for a replacement to be sent., My husband is deployed and I refuse to be without a phone for a week., The rep told me my next option was to drive 270 miles (the closest apple store) to pick one up? again, not going to happen., My last option was to front the $599.00 for the new replacement iphone and when Apple recieves my broken phone, they will credit my account., Poor customer service? and Im stuck with the choice to send the phone back and switch to another provider while Im in the 30 day decision period or deal with it???, 32JohnAugust 11, 2010 at 5:29 pm

@ivy that post is so fake and just made up bullcrap to make the phone and apple look bad., What about obsessive apple bashers?, 33ValconAugust 12, 2010 at 3:26 am

@Roger: that comparison doesn?t make sense., A 3GS is still a relative ?modern? device, and people are even willing to pay 400 euro?s for a second hand device., I don?t get it either, but reality can?t be denied., But what I was trying to tell, is that Apple eventually will abandon the ?provider exclusive? strategy because many customers prefer a good provider and won?t make the switch to T-Mobile, just for the iPhone., 34PulSamsaraAugust 19, 2010 at 11:00 am

If they could just put Android OS in this phone it would be perfect., 35AhmedAugust 20, 2010 at 2:09 am

iPhone is a life changing technology for most reasonably smart or better people, a fact Apple haters (many) will deny with all their sincerity., 36TomAugust 28, 2010 at 12:00 pm

I switched from a 3G to iP4 on day one and immediately had problems with dropped calls., The bumper helped, but I was dropping a quarter of my calls at home and at work where my old iPhone worked fine and my wife?s 3GS continues to work today., I get dropped and failed calls even with 3 reception bars., I went to the Apple store and was told to drive to the AT&T store for a new SIMM., They replaced the SIMM, and I walked to the sidewalk in front of the AT&T store and tried to call my wife., Went back in to the AT&T store and was told to go back to the Apple store., At the Apple store they said to reinstall the software as a new phone., I did, and it didn?t help., I returned to the Apple store and they gave me a new phone., As a quick aside, I picked up the new phone, put it into a death-grip without the bumper, and in front of the Apple Genius and the screen went blank in about 5 seconds., He looked at me and basically said, ?Sorry, that?s the way they are.?
Now after a week with my second iPhone 4, I still get continual dropped calls in locations where others with older iPhones have no problem (I?m the only one at work with an iP4, the others have 3G?s and 3GS?s and they have no issues)., Clearly in my case, the iPhone 4 is a dysfunctional product ? both of them., I?ve been purchasing Apple products since 1979, my small business is all Apple, but this is the first time I?ve regretted buying a Apple product., But what I find really interesting is the controversy around all this., There are people on this board who will accuse me of being an Apple hater, people who will say I?m making this up, and were I to post this message on the Apple board, their moderator would delete it., There will be people who say this is all a non-issue because they have no problem., It?s as if there is an organized effort to minimize issues like this., What I don?t hear are any helpful solutions, only polite apologies from the Apple Store Geniuses who seem to be caught in the middle., 37ColinAugust 30, 2010 at 6:15 pm

In the last month I have purchased an iPad and now an iPhone 4 and have changed my opinion of apple products., Both have proved easier to use and more functional than previous windows and palm based products., In Oz we have a choice of all carriers and the provider with the better network (Telstra) has finally come up with competitive plans., Performance has been fantastic with speeds of up to 5mbs although this drops to 1mbps if I hold the phone in a death grip., 38Scentsy CandlesSeptember 11, 2010 at 11:50 am

Thank you for the great detail!!!, My husband and I purchased the new iPhone 4 yesterday., We LOVE it., We were long time customers of Verizon and after bad customer service, we decided to make a change to At&t., The only problem we have found is not being able to turn off our ITunes., 39JulieSeptember 11, 2010 at 3:49 pm

@Scentsy I?m not sure what you mean about not being able to turn off your iTunes., 40Phil ZadarnowskiSeptember 12, 2010 at 12:23 pm

I too, like Colin, have purchased both an iPad and an iPhone 4 in the last 2 months, having never owned an Apple product in my life., My experience is the same., Easy to use, fast and smooth interface, and add a jailbreak to each device and you?ve got one very nice and functional piece of gear., I was never an Apple basher as such, but being so impressed at the Apple IOS after buying an iPad, I was sold., I was going to buy a HTC Desire after seeing my colleagues phone, but I?m so glad I didn?t., Seeing the two side by side, there is absolutely no comparison., The iPhone and IOS are simply better in every way than the Desire and Android., Well done Mr., Its taken around 20 years to get my business, and I doubt anyone is going to impress me this much again., 41skyeSeptember 22, 2010 at 3:44 pm

I too have been trying to decide on which iphone to get., I always read reviews on everything before I purchase it,but, now I am more confused than I was., I have never owned an iphone before so it is completely new to me ?.can someone make suggestions?, 44Chumbe SalinasOctober 18, 2010 at 7:53 am

I left my 3G at the grocery store 2 days ago and it was not turned in., I can?t afford to buy another one until the end of this month., I was going to buy the 3GS because of the price but started thinking maybe I should invest the extra $100 and go for the 4., I had pretty much convinced myself but now after reading the above, I?m back on the fence!, I have 10 days to decide!, 45AngieOctober 21, 2010 at 11:55 pm

Hey guys, I am from Egypt?I have bought the iPhone 4 like 3 days ago?never owned an Apple device in my life?
I bought the phone to pamper myself with the cool option?I like the way it handles my business usages as well?
Never had a call dropped (I am on Vodafone)?but from time to time I just can?t log online  ? Some other times it downloads web pages faster than my pc?
I overuse the Internet, so I was thinking about
giving it back and getting an HTC Desire or something, but I really don?t want to?I would be like settling down for less if I did? I ordered some cases to deal with the antennas issue?do u really think it will do the trick?, Also, I have to charge it everyday, 46JamesNovember 2, 2010 at 10:58 pm

Great review!? I work most of the time in Mexico City and go back to Los Angeles every two months., The carrier in Mexico City is Telcel and their 3G coverage is great, I?ve never had a call drop and need to be underground for all signal bars to dissapear., However, when i go back home, i notice that the signal bars rarely reach 5, and some of the calls will be slightly noisy, so it?s obvious that there is an issue with At&t network., I was hesitant to purchase another Apple product(don?t like control freak companies), but I am very pleased with my iphone4., I use it mostly for work; mail, messenger, internet and to read books or take pictures while I travel., It?s easy to use and love the screen, I defenitely recommend it., 47Michael FrisinaNovember 10, 2010 at 7:47 pm

Wow, first I liked the review?second, to all those who DON?T own a phone that truely does EVERYTHING it?s supposed to do then you won?t be dissapointed with iphone (3G, 3GS or I4)., And, I do mean EVERYTHING!!!, I?ve had just about every smartphone out there from Blackberrys, Palms, motorola, to Droid platforms (X, aries, and evo) and while SOME features appear to work better in some sort of fashion, The iphone does everything it?s supposed to do, which is by far true for any other company, which might I also add are COPIES of the iphone, I mean really it doesn?t take a rocket scientist to figure out that the HTC Evo ?pinch and sqeeze? feature is copied and also doesn?t work like my iphone., Apple should sue in my opinion., Now I know that someone is going to say that I?ve ?drank the apple koolaid? and you know what?
If liking a product that I bought with my own hard earned money and appreciating it for fullfilling it?s promises and more is ?drinking the koolaid??THEN CONSIDER ME DRUNK!!!, 48ginaNovember 14, 2010 at 4:58 pm

i just purchased the iPhone 4 3 days ago and i love it., It?s the best phone ive had yet im verrrry pleased, 50Rob McCanceDecember 2, 2010 at 9:43 pm

I have the 3Gs in Atlanta and occasionally get dropped calls and stalled out data streams., Atlanta is the home of AT&T so it?s probably as good as it gets here., I also have a old Blackberry Curve on AT&T and it NEVER drops a call, EVER., It always instantly and flawlessly delivers every single email, YIM and BBM and PIN., So, for me, there IS something real to the iPhone / AT&T network issues many are experiencing., I go back and forth between the phones., Funny, when I?m traveling and know I will need great battery life and ultra reliable emails, YIM and BBM, I always take the Blackberry., Boring phone but man it works!, 51Rob McCanceDecember 2, 2010 at 9:45 pm

Oh yeah, liked the review Julie., Didn?t have any problems with the way you phrased things and appreciated your honesty., 52JimDecember 15, 2010 at 12:33 pm

I?ve been using other AT&T cell phones for years? love AT&T so when contract renewal date came around I thought I would try upgrading to the new iPhone 4., Lots of neat bells and whistles, but VERY unsatisfactory calling experiences., Virtually unusable as a cell phone with incomplete or dropped calls left and right., The number of bars showing would drift back and forth from 0 to 4 bars all the time., Calls would not go through with 3 bars., Had to return the phone as unusable., Otherwise the device is a required learning experience., The sensitivity of icons on the face make it very difficult to use., I kept selecting things by mistake., One other HUGE issue for me anyway was that with 300+ contacts on my phone, I need a way to keep my contacts backed up on PC., Turns out the only way for the iPhone 4 to be synced is with a the included USB cable and iTunes or the PC address book., The iPhone 4 does not support Bluetooth connectivity with iTunes., And there does not appear to be any other contact management software that runs on a PC., I tried the Chinese iPhone PC Suite but could not get it to run on Windows and a version for iMac is not available., by Julie on August 9, 2010 ? 59 comments, I?ve been using the Apple iPhone 4 since the day it was released., I ended up buying one without a contract since mine isn?t up for renewal till March of 2011., It was a pricey gadget purchase at over $500., Of course that never stopped me before   But let?s see if I?m still happy with my purchase after 45 days of living with this smartphone., Hardware Specifications

I really like the updated physical design of the iPhone 4., It?s thinner and sexier in my opinion., I really like the way the display and back surface go from edge to edge without a bezel for dirt and dust to collect., This phone feels like it has been carved out of a solid block of glass., I love the feel of it in my hand., It?s really solid and easily passes the gadgeteer squeeze test., This baby doesn?t flex, creak or crack when I squeeze it and there are no rattles when I shake it., Here it is next to my iPhone 3GS., You can?t tell much of a size difference looking at them from above?

But from the side, the difference is very noticeable., The iPhone 4 now has a stainless steel band around the sides., This band is the antenna of the phone., I?m not going to go into the whole deal with the antenna problems with this phone., I?m sure everyone is sick of hearing about this issue by now anyway., I?ll just say that I?ve been using my phone without a case and have not had one dropped call in the 45 days that I?ve been using the phone., That?s not to say that everything is peaches and cream with my call quality though., I?ve been an AT&T customer for years and my call quality has pretty much sucked for all of those years., It?s not unusual to have clicks and the occasional outside call that bleeds in.? The number of bars go up and down for no apparent reason., I?ve had this with any and all GSM phones that I?ve ever used., Phones will go back and forth from 1 bar, to full bars and all bars in between, while sitting in the exact same spot., On the left side of the phone, you?ll find the mute switch and volume buttons., I like the individual volume buttons and find them easier to operate than the rocker switch that the previous iPhone versions used., The buttons are raised and have good tactile feedback, making them very easy to find and press with your thumb while in a call., The right side is the new location for the SIM card slot., Good old Apple decided to go with a micro SIM card, which means that you?ll (I?ll) need an adapter if I wish to use the same SIM in a different GSM phone., I still haven?t ordered an adapter., Along the top edge, you?ll find the on/off wake/sleep button, 2nd microphone and headphone jack., The bottom edge has the main microphone along with the dock connector and speaker., The front of the phone has the familiar home button, speaker and a front facing VGA camera that can be used for the built in FaceTime application, as well as for self-portraits., The previous iPhone had a great display, but the new iPhone 4?s retina display is just plain gorgeous., It?s true, you can?t see the individual pixels at all., Screen sensitivity remains the same., It?s still easy to scroll, pinch and zoom using your fingers., The iPhone remains my favorite finger friendly display., FYI: the display is still difficult to see in direct sunlight?

One the back you?ll see the 5MP camera lens and the new LED flash next to it., Here are a couple sample pictures taken with the iPhone 4., You can click them to see the original sized image., I?m pretty happy with the image quality of this phone., The colors are vivid and the images are sharp., I?ve always been pretty impressed with the cameras in iPhones, so I don?t notice much difference except for more pixels., The iPhone still does great with macro shots., That?s one of my main criteria for a mobile phone camera and the iPhone passes the test., It also does a pretty decent job of capturing video., My Flip UltraHD video camera doesn?t get used anymore because the iPhone 4 does such a good job., The only thing to keep in mind though is that even though the specs say that it will record at 720p, if you upload to Youtube via your iPhone or email the video file to yourself, it will compresses it first., The resulting 568 x 320 resolution video looks pretty bad (see first video sample below)., If you want the uncompressed video off your iPhone, you can import the video into iPhoto (on a Mac), or use a free iPhone app like Pixelpipe to transfer the files., Video exported from iPhone directly to YouTube

So, we have a new form factor / case style, a better display and a better camera (actually dual cameras)., You might be wondering how the phone performs as an actual phone and how well the battery lasts., Call-wise, I don?t really notice anything different than my iPhone 3GS., I can make calls and receive calls., Call volume is fine., Call quality will depend entirely on how good AT&T is in your area., Although the coverage is good here in Columbus, Indiana., Call quality isn?t the best., I don?t blame the iPhone for this though., As I mentioned earlier, I?ve had the same issues with all GSM phones I?ve used with this carrier., I thought things might improve when we recently received 3G coverage, but nope? it?s still the same., In other words, it?s crappy., Although I don?t experience dropped calls, I often problems with clicking and bad audio quality., Another thing that annoys me is that I can have full bars and not be able to check the temperature with the weather app or my stocks with the stock app., It will just sit there and spin and spin and spin., It?s pretty embarrassing when I?m out to lunch with someone new and want to show them something cool with my phone and the data connection just doesn?t work., As far as system performance, the iPhone 4 is very snappy., Apps load almost instantly., I have no complaints at all as far as that is concerned., I also have no real complaints about battery life., I tend to charge the phone every other day and that works fine for me., My typical daily usage ranges from 10 or so text messages a day, 1-2 calls, 1hr of ebook reading with Stanza, a few minutes of app store browsing and / or app updating and a few minutes use here and there of various apps., So I pretty much love the hardware minus AT&T?s special sauce., Now let?s talk a little bit about software., Software
The two main new software features on the iPhone 4, which are also included in the iOS 4 update that you can also put on your iPhone 3G and 3GS (not all new features are available on the 3G), are folders and multitasking., Organizing your apps into folders is really easy to do., Just hold your finger down on an icon and then drag it on top of another icon to create a new folder with those two icons inside it., Each folder can have a maximum of 12 icons., The folder will be named automatically depending on the category of the programs, but you can rename it to whatever you wish., I like this new feature, but I do wish that there was the ability to change the folder icon., As it is, it shows a teeny tiny icon view of several of the apps that it holds., I should also mention that you can?t drag a folder into a folder?
 
Multitasking is a feature that iPhone users have been begging for since the original iPhone was first released 3 years ago., Apple has finally given it to us ? sorta., It should really be called task switching., And it?s important to realize that not all apps are multitaskable (yes, I just made up a new word)., Check the App Store or the developer?s webpage to verify the application supports multitasking., To switch between apps, you just double press the Home button., When you do, you?ll see your recently opened apps at the bottom., This strip of icons scrolls left to right., If you scroll all the way to the left, you may see some special options depending on the app you have open., For example, if Pandora or the iPod app is running, you?ll see play controls., If you want to close an app, you just hold your finger down on the icon till you see the minus symbol., From there, you can just tap the icons to close them., Unfortunately, there isn?t a Close All open apps feature., Other new OS features include:
Unified inbox ? Allows you to see messages from all your accounts in a unified inbox, organize messages by threads, open attachments in third-party apps, and more., Conclusion
It?s probably not going to be a surprise that I have a love / hate relationship with the iPhone 4., I?ve enjoyed using the iPhone since I purchased the original one., I love the display, the camera and of course, the wide variety of quality applications., That said, I am not a fan of AT&T?s call quality and data quality issues in my area., It really annoys me that for the last year,? I paid extra for 3G capability when it wasn?t even available in my town., Then when we finally did get it, the experience has been pretty blah., I am not going to blame the iPhone for these problems though because I think it?s more of a local carrier issue., But at the same time, it has introduced frustration into the equation and in some ways I regret that I spent so much for this phone., At the end of the day, I will happily recommend iPhone 4 as a capable and fun to use phone ? IF the AT&T coverage in your area is good., If it?s not so great, you?ll have to put up with the same issues I?ve dealt with for years., I guess it says something positive about the iPhone that I have lived with the problems because I?ve enjoyed the phone so much., Now it?s your turn., For those of you that purchased the iPhone 4 for the first time, or as an upgrade, are you still happy with your purchase after 45+ days?, Product Information

		Apple?s latest phone improves on predecessors with new design, impressive features, Posted on  by Jason Snell, Macworld.com, Apple is a company with some clear priorities when it comes to designing mobile devices., The ideal Apple mobile device is razor-thin, with a simple design and killer battery life., You can see those principles at work in the iPhone 4, the latest generation of Apple?s smartphone hardware., This is a smaller, thinner phone, with a stripped-down design and an impressive improvement in battery life compared to previous models., 4.0 out of 5 Mice Jun 28, 2010, 4.0 out of 5 Mice Jun 28, 2010, Analyst: Verizon needs iPhone badly, VoodooPad makes leap to iPhone and iPad, Analyst: Verizon needs iPhone badly, Three years ago, the original iPhone blasted a hole in the side of a listless, boring phone market., That initial success has spawned numerous strong competitors, but with the iPhone 4, Apple seems to be competing more with itself than trying to respond to the competition., A pair of fours
	If there?s one thing that defines Apple as a company, it?s the idea of creating products that are a synthesis of hardware and software., It makes the iPhone and the iOS., Many tech products are the melding of two different visions; Apple?s products are generally singular., As a result, much of the appeal of the iPhone 4 is in its tight integration with iOS 4, the latest version of the recently-renamed operating system that drives the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad., My colleague Dan Moren has already reviewed iOS 4, which adds features such as multitasking support and App folders to the mix, and I won?t repeat those points here., However, many of the iPhone 4?s hardware features wouldn?t make sense were it not for corresponding additions to iOS 4., It?s the Apple way, and iPhone 4 is no exception., But first, the hardware
	The iPhone 4 is recognizably an iPhone, bearing most of the same traits as all the other iOS devices Apple has released over the past three years: Glass front, rounded corners, big screen, circular button at the bottom., The white model, sadly unavailable on launch day, exposes that the iPhone owes a design debt to the classic iPod as well., This iPhone differs in details of design., The faces of previous iPhones have been surrounded by a chrome bezel, but that?s gone., Instead, there?s just the phone?s glass face and the thin silver edge of a stainless-steel frame that wraps around the device?s circumference., The frame?s matte texture is more in line with Apple?s current design aesthetic than the shiny bezel of previous models., Another big change is on the device?s back, which is now a flat glass surface rather than a curved polycarbonate shell., By swapping out the bezel and replacing the curved back, Apple has dramatically changed the feel of the iPhone., The curved edges of past iPhones are gone, replaced with 90-degree angles and flat surfaces, like a cake that?s been removed from its pan., In general, the product feels like a remarkably solid slab of technology., It?s thinner and narrower than its predecessors, but the same height., Since it packs its 4.8 ounces into a smaller space (4.5 inches by 2.31 inches by .37 inches), it?s noticeably denser?and I mean that in a good way., Like the iPad, the iPhone 4 feels like a remarkably solid, well-built product., The fit and finish are immaculate; not a single thing about the iPhone 4 feels cheap., If you don?t like my cake metaphor, try this one: in terms of styling, the iPhone 4 feels like the most expensive electric razor ever made, or maybe like a finely-tuned luxury watch., Apple has designed the iPhone?s steel frame to act as its wireless antennae; the strip of frame on the device?s left side serves at the antenna for its Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios, and the strip on the right side and bottom works as a cellular antenna., Attempts to quantify cell phone reception are always dodgy?reception varies from city to city and even block to block within a city., One of our editors reports that her iPhone 4 can actually get a (weak) signal in her apartment, where her iPhone 3G simply reported no service at all., Our colleagues at PCWorld report that the iPhone 4 has faster data speeds than the iPhone 3GS., In my testing, the iPhone 4 was extremely fast, especially when it came to data uploads., This boost in upload speeds is due to the iPhone 4 supporting HSUPA, a high-speed 3G upload protocol, in addition to the HSDPA protocol that was added to the iPhone line with the 3GS., In any event, the iPhone 4 was so fast, it put my poky old home DSL connection to shame?so much so that I?m finally going to replace it!, But unless you live in my particular suburban San Francisco neighborhood, your mileage will likely vary., Reports all over the Internet suggest that if you hold the iPhone 4 in such a way that your hand makes contact with both antennae (generally by holding the phone down toward its base, specifically touching on the left side), you can drastically decrease the iPhone 4?s cellular reception., The method of holding the iPhone in question is actually how I hold my iPhone?and I discovered, sitting in my own house, that I could slow or even stop my iPhone 4?s cellular data transfer by holding the phone in that way., It was such a dramatic effect that I was able to cause cellular data transfers to fail mid-stream just by shifting the phone in my hand., Judging by the Internet, just as many people have failed to reproduce this problem as have reproduced it., Maybe it varies based on your skin type, or what kind of cellular tower you?re connected to, or the relative strength or weakness of your cellular signal., Apple released a statement late last week saying that this sort of thing is common with cell phones., I?m not a cell phone engineer., Nor have I had the time to compile a detailed, scientific study of iPhone 4 performance to nail down just what?s causing this signal loss issue., (One would hope some Apple employees who qualify as the former are busily doing the latter right now.) What I do know is that when I hold the iPhone 4 as I am accustomed to holding it, in many cases the phone completely fails to transfer cellular data., And that?s not good., If you?re someone who doesn?t hold their iPhone that way, you won?t be affected by this., If you wrap the phone in one of Apple?s $29 iPhone 4 bumpers, they?ll insulate the phone from your hands and prevent them from causing interference., (I was able to hold the phone in the style to which I am accustomed, and with a bumper affixed I saw no connection problems at all.)
	I expect Apple will address this issue one way or another, either with a software fix or a hardware recall., For everyone?s sake, I hope it?s fixable in software; at the very least, I think Apple owes a free bumper to everyone who is affected by the problem while the company figures it out., The new iPhone is much thinner than its predecessors.In terms of ports and the like, the iPhone 4 is similar to its predecessors., There?s a standard Apple dock connector on the bottom, right between the speaker and microphone., The device?s left side still has a hold switch and volume up/down controls, though they?ve been redesigned: the hold switch is broader and slightly harder to budge; the volume rocker has been replaced by two discrete volume buttons, etched with plus and minus symbols., On the phone?s top is the Sleep/Wake button, a standard headphone jack, and a new addition: a second microphone., This new microphone can be used in a few different ways: when you?re shooting video or video chatting via the new FaceTime feature, it?s the primary microphone., When you?re holding the phone to your face and speaking via the microphone on the bottom of the phone, the top microphone is gathering in ambient sound to be used for noise-cancellation purposes., The trick seems to work, too: One of the first calls I made with the iPhone 4 was to a colleague, also with an iPhone 4, who apologized for the loud alarm going off in the background., ?What alarm?? I asked him?because I couldn?t hear it at all, only the sound of his voice., The iPhone 4?s noise cancellation won?t make your voice sound like you?re whispering into the ear of your interlocutors?it?s still a cell phone call, after all?but it does seem to do a decent job of dropping out extra junk and leaving just the sound of your voice behind., The iPhone 4?s right side is barren of landmarks, save a micro-SIM slot like the one found on the 3G iPad., By using a micro SIM, Apple freed up some space on the inside of the phone, while also ensuring that your old phones with full-sized SIM cards wouldn?t be compatible with your new devices without some SIM surgery., If you?re a fan of the curvy style of previous iPhone models, you may be disappointed by the design direction Apple has taken with the iPhone 4., Personally, I?m liking the flat surfaces and sharper angles., But Apple?s iPhone 4 bumpers, while providing some degree of protection for the device itself, also return some of that classic curvy feel when you hold it in your hand., (They also conveniently insulate the phone so that your hand can?t cause interference on the cellular antenna.)
	The only part of the iPhone 4 design that gives me pause is the all-glass back, which doubles the chance that if you drop the iPhone, you?ll end up hitting with the glass side down., I never really liked the polycarbonate back of the 3G and 3GS, but at least it was nearly bulletproof., As gorgeous as the iPhone 4 is to look at, I fear that most people will be cloaking them in protective cases in order to avoid shattering this shiny new toy., Pixel perfect
	Macro shot of the iPhone 4 display (top) and the display on the iPhone 3GS.If there?s a single feature that defines the iPhone 4, it?s the device?s new high-resolution screen., Dubbed the ?Retina display? by Apple, it?s got four times the pixels of previous iPhone models, packed into the same space., This 960-by-640 pixel display has a screen resolution of 326 pixels per inch, up from 163 ppi on previous iPhone models., When the first iPhone was released, its screen was amazing because 163 ppi was already a much higher resolution than the average computer screen., I shouldn?t even use the past tense there: the original iPhone screen is still quite good., Looking at it by itself, you can notice some jaggedness, but it?s nothing compared to what you?d get on a traditional computer., But technology has moved along., When I spent a week with a Google Nexus One smartphone earlier this year, I was impressed by its higher screen resolution, which made text on the Nexus One noticeably smoother than on my iPhone 3GS., Apple?s response to the improvements in display technology has not been to create a larger phone?a direction some of its rivals have taken?but to increase the number of dots in the existing space to the point where the average human eye (hence the ?retina display? moniker) can?t even tell they?re there., The result is marvelous., The retina display is an enormous improvement on the already-good iPhone 3GS screen, brighter and with better contrast as well as a slightly warmer color temperature., The screen, which uses the same IPS (in-plane switching) display technology found on the iPad and iMac, has a massive viewing angle, so even at an odd angle you can see everything on the screen clearly., And since the screen is bonded to the layer of glass immediately above it, it?s a bit closer to your eyes?there?s less of the sense that you?re looking at a display through a layer of glass than there was on previous iPhones or the iPad., As for the increased resolution, it?s staggering., High-definition videos play back with such smoothness and clarity that you feel like you?re looking through a tiny window into the real world., Tiny details on photos are clear as day., When I watch a video on my iPhone 3GS, I don?t notice that the individual stalks of wheat in the Van Gogh episode of Doctor Who
	 aren?t clear., But when I watch that same in HD quality on the iPhone 4?s screen, I can see the individual kernels on the stalks., It?s the same scene, but with exquisite detail that was lacking before., Text is similarly gorgeous., Yes, black text on a white background in Safari or iBooks looks like it was printed on paper., But what really exposes the power of the display is colored or gray text, which tended to look a bit jaggier on previous iPhones., On the iPhone 4, even light gray text is immaculate., If you?ve not yet seen an iPhone 4, you may stare at your current phone (or even PC screen) and wonder how this new display could be that much better than what you?ve already got., After I handled the iPhone 4 a few weeks before its release, I couldn?t quite believe what I had seen., When I stared at my iPhone 3GS display, I saw a really good screen., How could the iPhone 4?s screen have put it to shame?, And yet, when you view the two models side by side, you can see that the difference in quality isn?t even subtle., The iPhone 4?s screen is so good, it?s shocking., Smile for the camera(s)
	We are rapidly approaching the day where every device we own will be able to shoot HD video., Is the oatmeal in the microwave boiling over the side of the bowl?, Did the washing machine get that stain out of your favorite shirt?, A mountain lion ran right across the trail in front of your bike?, HD video or it didn?t happen., The iPhone 4 is the latest device to bring HD video to the party, and is capable of shooting 720p video at 30 frames per second., That?s not the only upgrade over previous models, though: the device?s rear-facing camera is powered by a 5-megapixel sensor., With the iPhone 3GS, Apple managed to build a cellphone camera that outperformed other phone cameras with higher megapixel counts, and that story continues with the iPhone 4., Though some comparable phones offer 8 megapixels of resolution, in our tests, the iPhone 4 (with its strong low-light performance and backside-illuminated chip design) outperformed all but dedicated point-and-shoot cameras., There?s no doubt that the iPhone 4?s camera is good., HD videos are clear and crisp and stills show remarkable detail., The redesigned Camera app in iOS 4 keeps things simple?rather than fiddling with settings, you just touch to set the point you want to use for focus and spot metering, and the camera adjusts immediately., There are simple controls to turn the iPhone 4?s new LED flash on and off and flip between the iPhone?s two onboard cameras (more on that second camera in a bit), as well as a digital zoom slider., I?m not a fan of the concept of digital zooming, which is more like an in-camera cropping effect than an actual zoom., It would be nice if the iPhone 4?s camera had an optical zoom, but given the space considerations it seems impossible., If you?re taking pictures of a kids? soccer match, you might want to bring a camera with a real zoom., But if you can fill the iPhone 4?s frame with whatever you want to shoot, you?ll get good results., The iPhone 4?s included LED flash addresses one of the big complaints about previous iPhone cameras: They just didn?t work very well in the dark., Well, now there?s a flash, so you can check that box., But quite frankly, I was disappointed by the flash., If you?re in a pitch-black room and there?s simply no other way to get a shot, you should use it., But in dim light, I found myself more satisfied with images I took without the flash., Using the flash generally left me with strangely colored shots full of red eye and (more often than not) an ugly mix of overilluminated and underilluminated sections, as if I had been shining a flashlight on a small portion of the frame., I appreciated the quality of the iPhone 4?s HD video, which approaches that of the Flip video series of cameras., I bought a dedicated HD camcorder last year, but it?s too big to carry everywhere., Having an HD video camera in your pocket all the time has got to be a good thing., I?m not saying the Flip products are doomed, exactly, but devices like the iPhone 4 are narrowing their potential market pretty severely., If you?ve got an iPhone 4, you don?t really need a Flip., Another reason an iPhone 4 beats a Flip: the introduction of iMovie for iPhone, an app that lets you quickly edit the videos you shot and then post them online., You can read our full review of iMovie for details., iMovie is by no means a perfect app: I find that I tend to shoot a bunch of stuff in one go with the intent of splitting it into different clips later on, a style that is completely useless with iMovie since it can?t split clips., But the fact remains, it lets you edit HD video on a phone, quickly and with a minimum of hassle., I can?t tell you how many times I wished I could stitch two or three clips together and mail them to a family member while on a trip; with iMovie, I can., Still, I?m not dumping my HD camcorder., The fact is, video shot with a dedicated camcorder will be of vastly better quality than video shot with any cell phone, including the iPhone 4., Like nearly all pocket camcorders, there?s no image stabilization, and bright colors against a dark background are badly blown out., The lack of a physical zoom limits your shooting options., And the audio recorded by the iPhone 4 when shooting video is of poor quality., On the other hand, the quality of still photos from the iPhone 4 is much more impressive., The iPhone 4 can?t compete with the still image quality of a current point-and-shoot camera, but the images are still quite good?on par with a dedicated camera from a few years ago., Actual-size image samples of the same object taken by all four generations of iPhone., Of course, there?s a second camera on the iPhone 4, just to the left of the speaker on the phone?s front., In terms of tech specs, it?s nothing to write home about: its resolution is a meager 640-by-480., But of course, this is Apple we?re talking about., That camera exists for a  reason, and the reason is a software feature of iOS 4 that?s only available on the iPhone 4., Get some FaceTime
	FaceTime images will automatically rotate as your iPhones rotate.People have been placing video calls on their computers for years, and in some parts of the world phones have been capable of video chat for a while now., Recent smartphone releases in the U.S, such as the HTC EVO 4G, have integrated forward-facing cameras in order to enable face-to-face videoconferences., And yet, for all of that, Apple has managed to get people to talk about iPhone 4?s FaceTime feature with a degree of buzz that it doesn?t seem to deserve., Although some of that has to do with Apple?s marketing genius, I suspect a lot of it has to do with the fact that no video call implementations on cell phones have really gained momentum., People have come to expect that when Apple implements something, that technology has finally arrived., The interesting choice Apple has made with FaceTime is implementing it as a part of the Phone app, rather than creating a unique FaceTime app devoted to videoconferencing., There are a few ways to start a FaceTime session with someone; you can dial their iPhone 4 and, once you?ve connected, tap the FaceTime button on the screen., You can also just tap on a person in the Contacts list, scroll down, and tap the FaceTime button, bypassing the traditional cell phone network altogether., All FaceTime calls appear in your recent call list, just as if they were traditional phone calls., It?s a simple approach that makes a whole lot of sense in a system that?s designed to connect iPhone 4 phones to each other., But in announcing the iPhone 4, Apple said it would encourage the adoption of FaceTime by other devices as well., As a result, it?s a little perplexing that FaceTime appears to key off of something as mundane as a telephone number., (For now, FaceTime also requires a Wi-Fi connection, and uses the Internet for all its communication?adding a little cognitive dissonance to the choice of the Phone app as the place where all FaceTime communications happen., If the person you?re trying to call is using a Wi-Fi network that?s behind a strict firewall, you may also have trouble connecting to them?just as it?s sometimes impossible to do a iChat video conference with some people on tightly controlled office networks.)
	It?s also unfortunate that, at least for now, iPhone 4 owners can only use FaceTime with other iPhone 4 users, and not interoperate with other video-chat clients such as Apple?s own iChat., (Given that FaceTime uses all the same sound effects as iChat, it seems inevitable that the two products will one day interoperate., Then again, the Messages app looks and sounds like iChat, and Apple has steadfastly resisted creating an iOS version of iChat.) It?s likely that Apple has tried to keep FaceTime as simple as possible for its initial roll-out on the iPhone 4, and then will modify it as needed as it adds other devices (such as Macs, iPads, and iPod touches) to the FaceTime party., Details of the implementation aside, FaceTime worked flawlessly for me., I connected with several fellow iPhone 4 early adopters and could see and hear them without any trouble at all., I even made an international FaceTime call, to Scotland, with ease., The iPhone 4?s speakerphone is loud enough to hold a FaceTime conversation., FaceTime?s smart enough to rotate the video window properly depending on how you?re holding your iPhone?and how the person you?re talking to is holding theirs., When someone rotates their phone, their window rotates as well., It?s very well thought out and couldn?t be easier to use., My only question is, will people use it?, Despite the hype when iChat AV was released, I don?t find myself video chatting routinely with anyone except my family on business trips., (And even if I take my iPhone 4 with me on those trips, I won?t be able to chat with my family on our iMac until iChat is updated to talk to FaceTime.) Video phone calls are very much something we all expected to happen in the future, and the future is clearly here?but were those visions of the future right?, A video call requires your full attention; I can wash dishes while I talk on my iPhone, but not if I?m using FaceTime., Holding that phone so that the camera is pointing at your face can also tire out your arm., My guess would be that user adoption of FaceTime will grow over time, as more devices support its protocols and especially once you can make those calls via the cellular network., And, of course, other apps should be able to access the iPhone 4?s front camera for their own purposes., (Skype, for example, should be able to build a version of its app for iPhone 4 that?s compatible with other Skype video chat services.) I?m not sure video calling will ever be as common as it is in science fiction, but if anything?s going to popularize it, FaceTime will., Bigger, Faster, Longer
	Although Apple doesn?t like to talk about specs, we know that the iPhone 4 is, like the iPad, powered by a custom-built A4 processor., It?s also got 512MB of onboard RAM, twice the amount found in the iPad, iPhone 3GS, and third-generation iPod touch (and four times the amount found in the first two iPhone and iPod touch models)., As a result, it?s the fastest iPhone ever made, and even faster than the iPad in some tests., Its larger amount of RAM means it will be able to take advantage of iOS 4?s multitasking features to keep more apps open simultaneously, as well., iOS speed tests: How the iPhone 4 compares, iPhone 3GS

	60, Smaller numbers are better except in the V8 v5 test., All devices tested with iOS 4.0 except where otherwise noted., Peggle and Star Defense tests measured time from tapping the app on the home screen to reaching first interactive ?game ready? screen., Sunspider is a WebKit JavaScript performance test, with results in seconds., V8 is version 5 of Google?s V8 JavaScript benchmark., NYTimes.com test measured number of seconds to load home page of nytimes.com., You can feel the iPhone 4?s speed everywhere you turn., Apps launch in an instant., Switching between apps happens in the blink of an eye., Actions that cause even the speedy iPhone 3GS to bog down, such as bringing up playback controls on streaming video such as in the MLB At Bat app, are instantaneous on the iPhone 4., Even high-resolution game graphics move fluidly., According to Apple, the A4 processor has the advantage of bringing more power to the equation while consuming less energy., That, combined, with the iPhone 4?s larger battery, gives Apple the confidence to claim that this model has 40 percent more talk time per charge than the iPhone 3GS., Testing a battery this large takes time; we?re in the process of running some tests and will report on them in the near future., From my first few days with the iPhone, my impression is that battery life is improved, making it a bit easier to get through a day without needing a charging session., Media master, with caveats
	Since the iPhone was introduced, there?s one app that I?ve used more than any other, by far: iPod., I use my iPhone to listen to music and podcasts during my public-transit commute, when I?m mowing the lawn, and when I?m washing the dishes., Media playback is where the iPhone shines, both in the hands-down excellent iPod app and (especially thanks to the multitasking features of iOS 4) third-party apps such as Pandora and MLB At Bat 2010., If I?ve got the choice between an iPad and an iPhone, I?ll choose the former to watch video, owing entirely to its larger screen., But the iPhone 4?s high-resolution display is spectacular for video playback, and finally there?s an iPhone that?s capable of playing back HD-quality video files., (Previous models couldn?t handle resolutions higher than standard-def.)
	Unfortunately, those 720p video files that play back with aplomb on the iPhone 4 can?t be played back on an HDTV via the iPhone., The iPhone 4 has the same external playback limitations as its predecessors: it can use an RGB, composite, or component adapter to display standard-def video, but that?s pretty much it., I?m not sure whether it?s a limitation of the iPod dock connector or just the onboard video circuitry, but it?s a shame: A device with the muscle to handle HD video should be able to display it on an HDTV., Macworld?s buying advice
	The tech world has changed in the year between the announcement of the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4., In the intervening time, Apple released the iPad, and created a whole new way for people to interact with iOS apps., As someone who has both an iPhone and an iPad, I?ve discovered that the amount of time I spent using my iPhone has been dramatically reduced, as I?ve moved my attention to the iPad versions of my favorite apps., So I have to view the iPhone 4 as something other than the ultimate expression of the iOS., Though its total screen resolution is nearly that of the iPad, the goal of the iPhone 4?s display is to ramp up detail?which is good, because otherwise the iPhone 4 wouldn?t fit in your pocket, and what good would it be then?, The iPhone 4 is, in many ways, the best iPhone Apple has ever made., It?s faster than the 3GS, yes, but it?s the screen that is the biggest leap forward in quality., The new face-forward camera not only works well with FaceTime, but opens the door to all sorts of other videoconferencing possibilities in the future., And the rear-facing camera has taken a big step forward from the 3GS, offering quite high-quality stills and Flip-class HD video., With the addition of iMovie, you?ve got an entire home video studio in your hand., If only the iPhone 4 could play those HD-caliber videos back on an external HDTV itself., The iPhone 4 is also the first real design departure for the iPhone in two years; I like the metal styling and the solid feel, and the flat glass front and back are gorgeous., But I?m concerned that the glass back adds an unnecessary level of fragility to the product., What?s the point of designing a beautiful product if it?s so fragile that your customers need to stick it in a case (or wrap it in a rubber bumper) in order to protect it?, And of course, I'm concerned about the fact that touching the phone in the wrong places can hamper cellular reception., The recent changes to AT&T?s wireless data plans means that a base level of iPhone service costs $15 less a month ($15 for 200MB versus $30 for unlimited data), which may entice many bill-averse consumers to finally take the iPhone plunge., For them, and for owners of original iPhones and two-year-old iPhone 3Gs, the iPhone 4 is a perfect match., If you?re a user of the iPhone 3GS, though, this new model is less of a step up?and you?ll probably have to pay a large upgrade fee to get it., If that?s the case, you?d probably be better off waiting until you?re eligible for a fully subsidized upgrade., Though you?ll miss out on the high-quality screen and front-facing camera in the meantime, the 3GS is still quite a fast device and takes full advantage of iOS 4.0., [Jason Snell is Macworld?s editorial director.], "iPhone 4: The Macworld review" Comments, Posting comment ..., Get Early Bird Savings, Make Your Dreams Come True!, Enter for a chance to win $25,000 or your choice of other great prizes in the Dream Come True Sweepstakes brought to you by Macworld.Enter now ?, Be sure to check out our complete iPhone coverage., Be an iPhoto Pro, Take advantage of all of iPhoto's features, big and small, to master your photo library, Tips for importing existing photos into iPhoto, Working with Places, How to correct color problems in iPhoto, Restore your old pictures with iPhoto, Macworld iPod Touch & iPhone App Review Essential Collections View all ?, Call me, call me anytimeAvoid blowing out your phone bill with these free Voice over IP (VoIP) and texting apps., View all 'Call me, call me anytime' apps ?, Analyst: Verizon needs iPhone badly, VoodooPad makes leap to iPhone and iPad, The Macalope Weekly: Tech execs say the darndest things, Analytix uses iPhone to track Web numbers, Google: Android phone activations outpace iPhone, Peel brings wireless home-theater control to iPhone, iTunes Rewind 2010 rounds up the year in apps, LG, VMware aim to deliver two smartphones in one, Remains of the Day: It ain't over 'til it's over, iPhone 4: The Macworld review
		Apple?s latest phone improves on predecessors with new design, impressive features, Posted on  by Jason Snell, Macworld.com, Apple is a company with some clear priorities when it comes to designing mobile devices., The ideal Apple mobile device is razor-thin, with a simple design and killer battery life., You can see those principles at work in the iPhone 4, the latest generation of Apple?s smartphone hardware., This is a smaller, thinner phone, with a stripped-down design and an impressive improvement in battery life compared to previous models., 4.0 out of 5 Mice Jun 28, 2010, 4.0 out of 5 Mice Jun 28, 2010, Analyst: Verizon needs iPhone badly, VoodooPad makes leap to iPhone and iPad, Analyst: Verizon needs iPhone badly, Three years ago, the original iPhone blasted a hole in the side of a listless, boring phone market., That initial success has spawned numerous strong competitors, but with the iPhone 4, Apple seems to be competing more with itself than trying to respond to the competition., A pair of fours
	If there?s one thing that defines Apple as a company, it?s the idea of creating products that are a synthesis of hardware and software., It makes the iPhone and the iOS., Many tech products are the melding of two different visions; Apple?s products are generally singular., As a result, much of the appeal of the iPhone 4 is in its tight integration with iOS 4, the latest version of the recently-renamed operating system that drives the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad., My colleague Dan Moren has already reviewed iOS 4, which adds features such as multitasking support and App folders to the mix, and I won?t repeat those points here., However, many of the iPhone 4?s hardware features wouldn?t make sense were it not for corresponding additions to iOS 4., It?s the Apple way, and iPhone 4 is no exception., But first, the hardware
	The iPhone 4 is recognizably an iPhone, bearing most of the same traits as all the other iOS devices Apple has released over the past three years: Glass front, rounded corners, big screen, circular button at the bottom., The white model, sadly unavailable on launch day, exposes that the iPhone owes a design debt to the classic iPod as well., This iPhone differs in details of design., The faces of previous iPhones have been surrounded by a chrome bezel, but that?s gone., Instead, there?s just the phone?s glass face and the thin silver edge of a stainless-steel frame that wraps around the device?s circumference., The frame?s matte texture is more in line with Apple?s current design aesthetic than the shiny bezel of previous models., Another big change is on the device?s back, which is now a flat glass surface rather than a curved polycarbonate shell., By swapping out the bezel and replacing the curved back, Apple has dramatically changed the feel of the iPhone., The curved edges of past iPhones are gone, replaced with 90-degree angles and flat surfaces, like a cake that?s been removed from its pan., In general, the product feels like a remarkably solid slab of technology., It?s thinner and narrower than its predecessors, but the same height., Since it packs its 4.8 ounces into a smaller space (4.5 inches by 2.31 inches by .37 inches), it?s noticeably denser?and I mean that in a good way., Like the iPad, the iPhone 4 feels like a remarkably solid, well-built product., The fit and finish are immaculate; not a single thing about the iPhone 4 feels cheap., If you don?t like my cake metaphor, try this one: in terms of styling, the iPhone 4 feels like the most expensive electric razor ever made, or maybe like a finely-tuned luxury watch., Apple has designed the iPhone?s steel frame to act as its wireless antennae; the strip of frame on the device?s left side serves at the antenna for its Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios, and the strip on the right side and bottom works as a cellular antenna., Attempts to quantify cell phone reception are always dodgy?reception varies from city to city and even block to block within a city., One of our editors reports that her iPhone 4 can actually get a (weak) signal in her apartment, where her iPhone 3G simply reported no service at all., Our colleagues at PCWorld report that the iPhone 4 has faster data speeds than the iPhone 3GS., In my testing, the iPhone 4 was extremely fast, especially when it came to data uploads., This boost in upload speeds is due to the iPhone 4 supporting HSUPA, a high-speed 3G upload protocol, in addition to the HSDPA protocol that was added to the iPhone line with the 3GS., In any event, the iPhone 4 was so fast, it put my poky old home DSL connection to shame?so much so that I?m finally going to replace it!, But unless you live in my particular suburban San Francisco neighborhood, your mileage will likely vary., Reports all over the Internet suggest that if you hold the iPhone 4 in such a way that your hand makes contact with both antennae (generally by holding the phone down toward its base, specifically touching on the left side), you can drastically decrease the iPhone 4?s cellular reception., The method of holding the iPhone in question is actually how I hold my iPhone?and I discovered, sitting in my own house, that I could slow or even stop my iPhone 4?s cellular data transfer by holding the phone in that way., It was such a dramatic effect that I was able to cause cellular data transfers to fail mid-stream just by shifting the phone in my hand., Judging by the Internet, just as many people have failed to reproduce this problem as have reproduced it., Maybe it varies based on your skin type, or what kind of cellular tower you?re connected to, or the relative strength or weakness of your cellular signal., Apple released a statement late last week saying that this sort of thing is common with cell phones., I?m not a cell phone engineer., Nor have I had the time to compile a detailed, scientific study of iPhone 4 performance to nail down just what?s causing this signal loss issue., (One would hope some Apple employees who qualify as the former are busily doing the latter right now.) What I do know is that when I hold the iPhone 4 as I am accustomed to holding it, in many cases the phone completely fails to transfer cellular data., And that?s not good., If you?re someone who doesn?t hold their iPhone that way, you won?t be affected by this., If you wrap the phone in one of Apple?s $29 iPhone 4 bumpers, they?ll insulate the phone from your hands and prevent them from causing interference., (I was able to hold the phone in the style to which I am accustomed, and with a bumper affixed I saw no connection problems at all.)
	I expect Apple will address this issue one way or another, either with a software fix or a hardware recall., For everyone?s sake, I hope it?s fixable in software; at the very least, I think Apple owes a free bumper to everyone who is affected by the problem while the company figures it out., The new iPhone is much thinner than its predecessors.In terms of ports and the like, the iPhone 4 is similar to its predecessors., There?s a standard Apple dock connector on the bottom, right between the speaker and microphone., The device?s left side still has a hold switch and volume up/down controls, though they?ve been redesigned: the hold switch is broader and slightly harder to budge; the volume rocker has been replaced by two discrete volume buttons, etched with plus and minus symbols., On the phone?s top is the Sleep/Wake button, a standard headphone jack, and a new addition: a second microphone., This new microphone can be used in a few different ways: when you?re shooting video or video chatting via the new FaceTime feature, it?s the primary microphone., When you?re holding the phone to your face and speaking via the microphone on the bottom of the phone, the top microphone is gathering in ambient sound to be used for noise-cancellation purposes., The trick seems to work, too: One of the first calls I made with the iPhone 4 was to a colleague, also with an iPhone 4, who apologized for the loud alarm going off in the background., ?What alarm?? I asked him?because I couldn?t hear it at all, only the sound of his voice., The iPhone 4?s noise cancellation won?t make your voice sound like you?re whispering into the ear of your interlocutors?it?s still a cell phone call, after all?but it does seem to do a decent job of dropping out extra junk and leaving just the sound of your voice behind., The iPhone 4?s right side is barren of landmarks, save a micro-SIM slot like the one found on the 3G iPad., By using a micro SIM, Apple freed up some space on the inside of the phone, while also ensuring that your old phones with full-sized SIM cards wouldn?t be compatible with your new devices without some SIM surgery., If you?re a fan of the curvy style of previous iPhone models, you may be disappointed by the design direction Apple has taken with the iPhone 4., Personally, I?m liking the flat surfaces and sharper angles., But Apple?s iPhone 4 bumpers, while providing some degree of protection for the device itself, also return some of that classic curvy feel when you hold it in your hand., (They also conveniently insulate the phone so that your hand can?t cause interference on the cellular antenna.)
	The only part of the iPhone 4 design that gives me pause is the all-glass back, which doubles the chance that if you drop the iPhone, you?ll end up hitting with the glass side down., I never really liked the polycarbonate back of the 3G and 3GS, but at least it was nearly bulletproof., As gorgeous as the iPhone 4 is to look at, I fear that most people will be cloaking them in protective cases in order to avoid shattering this shiny new toy., Pixel perfect
	Macro shot of the iPhone 4 display (top) and the display on the iPhone 3GS.If there?s a single feature that defines the iPhone 4, it?s the device?s new high-resolution screen., Dubbed the ?Retina display? by Apple, it?s got four times the pixels of previous iPhone models, packed into the same space., This 960-by-640 pixel display has a screen resolution of 326 pixels per inch, up from 163 ppi on previous iPhone models., When the first iPhone was released, its screen was amazing because 163 ppi was already a much higher resolution than the average computer screen., I shouldn?t even use the past tense there: the original iPhone screen is still quite good., Looking at it by itself, you can notice some jaggedness, but it?s nothing compared to what you?d get on a traditional computer., But technology has moved along., When I spent a week with a Google Nexus One smartphone earlier this year, I was impressed by its higher screen resolution, which made text on the Nexus One noticeably smoother than on my iPhone 3GS., Apple?s response to the improvements in display technology has not been to create a larger phone?a direction some of its rivals have taken?but to increase the number of dots in the existing space to the point where the average human eye (hence the ?retina display? moniker) can?t even tell they?re there., The result is marvelous., The retina display is an enormous improvement on the already-good iPhone 3GS screen, brighter and with better contrast as well as a slightly warmer color temperature., The screen, which uses the same IPS (in-plane switching) display technology found on the iPad and iMac, has a massive viewing angle, so even at an odd angle you can see everything on the screen clearly., And since the screen is bonded to the layer of glass immediately above it, it?s a bit closer to your eyes?there?s less of the sense that you?re looking at a display through a layer of glass than there was on previous iPhones or the iPad., As for the increased resolution, it?s staggering., High-definition videos play back with such smoothness and clarity that you feel like you?re looking through a tiny window into the real world., Tiny details on photos are clear as day., When I watch a video on my iPhone 3GS, I don?t notice that the individual stalks of wheat in the Van Gogh episode of Doctor Who
	 aren?t clear., But when I watch that same in HD quality on the iPhone 4?s screen, I can see the individual kernels on the stalks., It?s the same scene, but with exquisite detail that was lacking before., Text is similarly gorgeous., Yes, black text on a white background in Safari or iBooks looks like it was printed on paper., But what really exposes the power of the display is colored or gray text, which tended to look a bit jaggier on previous iPhones., On the iPhone 4, even light gray text is immaculate., If you?ve not yet seen an iPhone 4, you may stare at your current phone (or even PC screen) and wonder how this new display could be that much better than what you?ve already got., After I handled the iPhone 4 a few weeks before its release, I couldn?t quite believe what I had seen., When I stared at my iPhone 3GS display, I saw a really good screen., How could the iPhone 4?s screen have put it to shame?, And yet, when you view the two models side by side, you can see that the difference in quality isn?t even subtle., The iPhone 4?s screen is so good, it?s shocking., Smile for the camera(s)
	We are rapidly approaching the day where every device we own will be able to shoot HD video., Is the oatmeal in the microwave boiling over the side of the bowl?, Did the washing machine get that stain out of your favorite shirt?, A mountain lion ran right across the trail in front of your bike?, HD video or it didn?t happen., The iPhone 4 is the latest device to bring HD video to the party, and is capable of shooting 720p video at 30 frames per second., That?s not the only upgrade over previous models, though: the device?s rear-facing camera is powered by a 5-megapixel sensor., With the iPhone 3GS, Apple managed to build a cellphone camera that outperformed other phone cameras with higher megapixel counts, and that story continues with the iPhone 4., Though some comparable phones offer 8 megapixels of resolution, in our tests, the iPhone 4 (with its strong low-light performance and backside-illuminated chip design) outperformed all but dedicated point-and-shoot cameras., There?s no doubt that the iPhone 4?s camera is good., HD videos are clear and crisp and stills show remarkable detail., The redesigned Camera app in iOS 4 keeps things simple?rather than fiddling with settings, you just touch to set the point you want to use for focus and spot metering, and the camera adjusts immediately., There are simple controls to turn the iPhone 4?s new LED flash on and off and flip between the iPhone?s two onboard cameras (more on that second camera in a bit), as well as a digital zoom slider., I?m not a fan of the concept of digital zooming, which is more like an in-camera cropping effect than an actual zoom., It would be nice if the iPhone 4?s camera had an optical zoom, but given the space considerations it seems impossible., If you?re taking pictures of a kids? soccer match, you might want to bring a camera with a real zoom., But if you can fill the iPhone 4?s frame with whatever you want to shoot, you?ll get good results., The iPhone 4?s included LED flash addresses one of the big complaints about previous iPhone cameras: They just didn?t work very well in the dark., Well, now there?s a flash, so you can check that box., But quite frankly, I was disappointed by the flash., If you?re in a pitch-black room and there?s simply no other way to get a shot, you should use it., But in dim light, I found myself more satisfied with images I took without the flash., Using the flash generally left me with strangely colored shots full of red eye and (more often than not) an ugly mix of overilluminated and underilluminated sections, as if I had been shining a flashlight on a small portion of the frame., I appreciated the quality of the iPhone 4?s HD video, which approaches that of the Flip video series of cameras., I bought a dedicated HD camcorder last year, but it?s too big to carry everywhere., Having an HD video camera in your pocket all the time has got to be a good thing., I?m not saying the Flip products are doomed, exactly, but devices like the iPhone 4 are narrowing their potential market pretty severely., If you?ve got an iPhone 4, you don?t really need a Flip., Another reason an iPhone 4 beats a Flip: the introduction of iMovie for iPhone, an app that lets you quickly edit the videos you shot and then post them online., You can read our full review of iMovie for details., iMovie is by no means a perfect app: I find that I tend to shoot a bunch of stuff in one go with the intent of splitting it into different clips later on, a style that is completely useless with iMovie since it can?t split clips., But the fact remains, it lets you edit HD video on a phone, quickly and with a minimum of hassle., I can?t tell you how many times I wished I could stitch two or three clips together and mail them to a family member while on a trip; with iMovie, I can., Still, I?m not dumping my HD camcorder., The fact is, video shot with a dedicated camcorder will be of vastly better quality than video shot with any cell phone, including the iPhone 4., Like nearly all pocket camcorders, there?s no image stabilization, and bright colors against a dark background are badly blown out., The lack of a physical zoom limits your shooting options., And the audio recorded by the iPhone 4 when shooting video is of poor quality., On the other hand, the quality of still photos from the iPhone 4 is much more impressive., The iPhone 4 can?t compete with the still image quality of a current point-and-shoot camera, but the images are still quite good?on par with a dedicated camera from a few years ago., Actual-size image samples of the same object taken by all four generations of iPhone., Of course, there?s a second camera on the iPhone 4, just to the left of the speaker on the phone?s front., In terms of tech specs, it?s nothing to write home about: its resolution is a meager 640-by-480., But of course, this is Apple we?re talking about., That camera exists for a  reason, and the reason is a software feature of iOS 4 that?s only available on the iPhone 4., Get some FaceTime
	FaceTime images will automatically rotate as your iPhones rotate.People have been placing video calls on their computers for years, and in some parts of the world phones have been capable of video chat for a while now., Recent smartphone releases in the U.S, such as the HTC EVO 4G, have integrated forward-facing cameras in order to enable face-to-face videoconferences., And yet, for all of that, Apple has managed to get people to talk about iPhone 4?s FaceTime feature with a degree of buzz that it doesn?t seem to deserve., Although some of that has to do with Apple?s marketing genius, I suspect a lot of it has to do with the fact that no video call implementations on cell phones have really gained momentum., People have come to expect that when Apple implements something, that technology has finally arrived., The interesting choice Apple has made with FaceTime is implementing it as a part of the Phone app, rather than creating a unique FaceTime app devoted to videoconferencing., There are a few ways to start a FaceTime session with someone; you can dial their iPhone 4 and, once you?ve connected, tap the FaceTime button on the screen., You can also just tap on a person in the Contacts list, scroll down, and tap the FaceTime button, bypassing the traditional cell phone network altogether., All FaceTime calls appear in your recent call list, just as if they were traditional phone calls., It?s a simple approach that makes a whole lot of sense in a system that?s designed to connect iPhone 4 phones to each other., But in announcing the iPhone 4, Apple said it would encourage the adoption of FaceTime by other devices as well., As a result, it?s a little perplexing that FaceTime appears to key off of something as mundane as a telephone number., (For now, FaceTime also requires a Wi-Fi connection, and uses the Internet for all its communication?adding a little cognitive dissonance to the choice of the Phone app as the place where all FaceTime communications happen., If the person you?re trying to call is using a Wi-Fi network that?s behind a strict firewall, you may also have trouble connecting to them?just as it?s sometimes impossible to do a iChat video conference with some people on tightly controlled office networks.)
	It?s also unfortunate that, at least for now, iPhone 4 owners can only use FaceTime with other iPhone 4 users, and not interoperate with other video-chat clients such as Apple?s own iChat., (Given that FaceTime uses all the same sound effects as iChat, it seems inevitable that the two products will one day interoperate., Then again, the Messages app looks and sounds like iChat, and Apple has steadfastly resisted creating an iOS version of iChat.) It?s likely that Apple has tried to keep FaceTime as simple as possible for its initial roll-out on the iPhone 4, and then will modify it as needed as it adds other devices (such as Macs, iPads, and iPod touches) to the FaceTime party., Details of the implementation aside, FaceTime worked flawlessly for me., I connected with several fellow iPhone 4 early adopters and could see and hear them without any trouble at all., I even made an international FaceTime call, to Scotland, with ease., The iPhone 4?s speakerphone is loud enough to hold a FaceTime conversation., FaceTime?s smart enough to rotate the video window properly depending on how you?re holding your iPhone?and how the person you?re talking to is holding theirs., When someone rotates their phone, their window rotates as well., It?s very well thought out and couldn?t be easier to use., My only question is, will people use it?, Despite the hype when iChat AV was released, I don?t find myself video chatting routinely with anyone except my family on business trips., (And even if I take my iPhone 4 with me on those trips, I won?t be able to chat with my family on our iMac until iChat is updated to talk to FaceTime.) Video phone calls are very much something we all expected to happen in the future, and the future is clearly here?but were those visions of the future right?, A video call requires your full attention; I can wash dishes while I talk on my iPhone, but not if I?m using FaceTime., Holding that phone so that the camera is pointing at your face can also tire out your arm., My guess would be that user adoption of FaceTime will grow over time, as more devices support its protocols and especially once you can make those calls via the cellular network., And, of course, other apps should be able to access the iPhone 4?s front camera for their own purposes., (Skype, for example, should be able to build a version of its app for iPhone 4 that?s compatible with other Skype video chat services.) I?m not sure video calling will ever be as common as it is in science fiction, but if anything?s going to popularize it, FaceTime will., Bigger, Faster, Longer
	Although Apple doesn?t like to talk about specs, we know that the iPhone 4 is, like the iPad, powered by a custom-built A4 processor., It?s also got 512MB of onboard RAM, twice the amount found in the iPad, iPhone 3GS, and third-generation iPod touch (and four times the amount found in the first two iPhone and iPod touch models)., As a result, it?s the fastest iPhone ever made, and even faster than the iPad in some tests., Its larger amount of RAM means it will be able to take advantage of iOS 4?s multitasking features to keep more apps open simultaneously, as well., iOS speed tests: How the iPhone 4 compares, iPhone 3GS

	Since the iPhone was introduced, there?s one app that I?ve used more than any other, by far: iPod., I use my iPhone to listen to music and podcasts during my public-transit commute, when I?m mowing the lawn, and when I?m washing the dishes., Media playback is where the iPhone shines, both in the hands-down excellent iPod app and (especially thanks to the multitasking features of iOS 4) third-party apps such as Pandora and MLB At Bat 2010., If I?ve got the choice between an iPad and an iPhone, I?ll choose the former to watch video, owing entirely to its larger screen., But the iPhone 4?s high-resolution display is spectacular for video playback, and finally there?s an iPhone that?s capable of playing back HD-quality video files., (Previous models couldn?t handle resolutions higher than standard-def.)
	Unfortunately, those 720p video files that play back with aplomb on the iPhone 4 can?t be played back on an HDTV via the iPhone., The iPhone 4 has the same external playback limitations as its predecessors: it can use an RGB, composite, or component adapter to display standard-def video, but that?s pretty much it., I?m not sure whether it?s a limitation of the iPod dock connector or just the onboard video circuitry, but it?s a shame: A device with the muscle to handle HD video should be able to display it on an HDTV., Macworld?s buying advice
	The tech world has changed in the year between the announcement of the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4., In the intervening time, Apple released the iPad, and created a whole new way for people to interact with iOS apps., As someone who has both an iPhone and an iPad, I?ve discovered that the amount of time I spent using my iPhone has been dramatically reduced, as I?ve moved my attention to the iPad versions of my favorite apps., So I have to view the iPhone 4 as something other than the ultimate expression of the iOS., Though its total screen resolution is nearly that of the iPad, the goal of the iPhone 4?s display is to ramp up detail?which is good, because otherwise the iPhone 4 wouldn?t fit in your pocket, and what good would it be then?, The iPhone 4 is, in many ways, the best iPhone Apple has ever made., It?s faster than the 3GS, yes, but it?s the screen that is the biggest leap forward in quality., The new face-forward camera not only works well with FaceTime, but opens the door to all sorts of other videoconferencing possibilities in the future., And the rear-facing camera has taken a big step forward from the 3GS, offering quite high-quality stills and Flip-class HD video., With the addition of iMovie, you?ve got an entire home video studio in your hand., If only the iPhone 4 could play those HD-caliber videos back on an external HDTV itself., The iPhone 4 is also the first real design departure for the iPhone in two years; I like the metal styling and the solid feel, and the flat glass front and back are gorgeous., But I?m concerned that the glass back adds an unnecessary level of fragility to the product., What?s the point of designing a beautiful product if it?s so fragile that your customers need to stick it in a case (or wrap it in a rubber bumper) in order to protect it?, And of course, I'm concerned about the fact that touching the phone in the wrong places can hamper cellular reception., The recent changes to AT&T?s wireless data plans means that a base level of iPhone service costs $15 less a month ($15 for 200MB versus $30 for unlimited data), which may entice many bill-averse consumers to finally take the iPhone plunge., For them, and for owners of original iPhones and two-year-old iPhone 3Gs, the iPhone 4 is a perfect match., If you?re a user of the iPhone 3GS, though, this new model is less of a step up?and you?ll probably have to pay a large upgrade fee to get it., If that?s the case, you?d probably be better off waiting until you?re eligible for a fully subsidized upgrade., Though you?ll miss out on the high-quality screen and front-facing camera in the meantime, the 3GS is still quite a fast device and takes full advantage of iOS 4.0., [Jason Snell is Macworld?s editorial director.], "iPhone 4: The Macworld review" Comments, Posting comment ..., Get Early Bird Savings, Make Your Dreams Come True!, Enter for a chance to win $25,000 or your choice of other great prizes in the Dream Come True Sweepstakes brought to you by Macworld.Enter now ?, Be sure to check out our complete iPhone coverage., Be an iPhoto Pro, Take advantage of all of iPhoto's features, big and small, to master your photo library, Tips for importing existing photos into iPhoto, Working with Places, How to correct color problems in iPhoto, Restore your old pictures with iPhoto, Macworld iPod Touch & iPhone App Review Essential Collections View all ?, Call me, call me anytimeAvoid blowing out your phone bill with these free Voice over IP (VoIP) and texting apps., View all 'Call me, call me anytime' apps ?, Analyst: Verizon needs iPhone badly, VoodooPad makes leap to iPhone and iPad, The Macalope Weekly: Tech execs say the darndest things, Analytix uses iPhone to track Web numbers, Google: Android phone activations outpace iPhone, Peel brings wireless home-theater control to iPhone, iTunes Rewind 2010 rounds up the year in apps, LG, VMware aim to deliver two smartphones in one, Remains of the Day: It ain't over 'til it's over, The iPhone 4 is Apple's "biggest leap since the original iPhone," at least according to Steven P., Jobs speaking at the WWDC 2010 keynote., Indeed, in the three years since Apple first introduced the iPhone, the device has come quite far., At the same time, the basic concepts behind the iPhone have remained very consistent over the years., Despite regular modifications to the OS and yearly hardware upgrades, the iPhone 4 is very much a more modern, more capable version of that original device that made such a splash in the industry back in 2007., We're not living with our heads in the sand: if you have come to hate the iPhone, walled gardens for developers, and everything Apple stands for, you will likely hate the iPhone 4, and there's nothing anyone can say to change your mind., Luckily for you, Apple is no longer competing against the saddest of the sad: there are now plenty of solid phones from other manufacturers that have multitouch screens, app stores of their own, great cameras, and much more extensible OSs., If you are curious about Apple's latest offering, however, read on., The iPhone 4 is not without its flaws?some of them more serious than others?but the device remains a really cool evolution in Apple's lineup., (We have already reviewed the majority of the OS, now called iOS 4, in a separate review., If you're looking to read about our impressions of the features in iOS 4, go read that one first and come back., This review is focused on the hardware of the new iPhone and on specific parts of iOS 4 that are limited to the iPhone 4.)

What you get in your grubby little hands

The iPhone 4 comes with the same accessories that iPhones have come with since the iPhone 3G launched in 2008 (sans microfiber cloth): a wall plug, a syncing cable, and a set of Apple earbuds with a built-in mic., The device does not come with a dock?that costs extra, to the tune of $30?but a dock isn't necessary in order to use it with a computer., (I prefer using a dock at my desk, however, so I always find myself forking over the dock tax.), The phone itself, as you likely already know, has a completely new design compared to previous generations of iPhones., Gone is the curved back of the iPhone 3GS and 3G, and the plastic has given way to glass., The iPhone 4 is flat from top to bottom, making it considerably thinner than its predecessor: 0.37 inches thick versus the 0.48 of the 3GS/3G., Otherwise, it's basically the same overall shape: 4.5 inches tall (same as previous iPhones) and 2.31 inches wide (slightly thinner)., iPhone 4 on the left, 3GS on the right, The iPhone 4 on the left is 24 percent thinner than the 3GS on the right, You might think that the 0.11 inch difference wouldn't be all that noticeable, and it doesn't even look like much in the picture, but it is?possibly because the back is now flat and doesn't have the same "fat" feeling of the 3GS and 3G., For comparison's sake, the HTC Evo is also 0.47 inches thick, almost the same as the iPhone 3GS, but otherwise has very similar dimensions to the iPhone 4 (4.63 inches tall and 2.3 inches wide)., Weight-wise, they are all similar as well: the iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS are both 4.8oz., Read more stories, Newer Story >, Jailbreak "detection" API now gone from iOS 4.2, Next-gen iPad rumored to get front-, rear-facing cameras, Apple may drop NVIDIA for Sandy Bridge's IGP next year, Click here to view the 358 comments on this story, MOBILITY?

? Ask The Editors, Has Apple come up with the next "Jesus Phone"?, Read our full Apple iPhone 4 review here to find out., iPhone 4 Overview

It's good to be the king., Or at least it was., Until the rest of the land began forming their own castles and employing their own hierarchical structures and empowering their own citizens., Yes, the iPhone 4 is a dazzling new device that sits in a faded throne., Rather than feel an ever-present sense of complacence, the iPhone 4 has to stand guard day and night., Samsung's Galaxy S phones, HTC's Droid Incredible and EVO, Motorola's Droid X and Droid 2 and Blackberry's Bold 9800 are encroaching and threatening to usurp the smartphone crown., Have no fear, for the iPhone 4 offers some essential and shiny upgrades like its Retina display, 5-megapixel camera with 720p, FaceTime Web chat, and bolstered processing guts., But with so many other advanced smartphone kingdoms forming over the neighboring hills, the iPhone 4's upgrades can only solidify its place as one of the premiere entertainment smartphones rather than a business powerhouse as well., Let's let down the drawbridge and head inside the castle., iPhone 4 Design and Retina Display

Apple is touting the iPhone 4 as the world's thinnest smartphone, measuring in at 9.3mm thick, but it's also heavier than we expected., The Samsung Captivate felt like a feather next to the iPhone 4, but Apple makes up for its weight in the quality department., Remember that cheap plastic back on the iPhone 3G that was prone to scratching?, How about the plastic Silent Mode tab that suddenly snapped off a few months down the road?, Well, the iPhone 4's body construction is fused together by a solid stainless steel band that also integrates antennas., For the record, we never experienced any antenna issues!, Along this band resides a structurally sound metal Silent Mode tab with two round volume control buttons, independent of one another for better control., On top we have the Lock/Power button and an accompanying 3.5mm audio jack., The Apple iPhone 4 is equipped with a speaker and a microphone for FaceTime chats, both of which are located along the bottom of the phone., The SIM card slot is concealed nicely along the right side of the phone while the front and back panels of the iPhone 4 ooze with glossy swank., The panels are composed of the same aluminosilicate glass used in helicopter and high-speed train windshields, so they can withstand a fairly hefty dosage of gravitational force, as in skydiving., We think the Apple iPhone 4 is without a doubt the sexiest smartphone on the market, and its Retina display just adds more fuel to the fire., The iPhone's 3.5-inch screen is not as impressive when compared to the Samsung Captivate's 4-inch screen, but its 960 x 640-pixel resolution makes up for the short staffing in the dimensions department., The iPhone 4's screen cranks out 326 pixels per square inch, and we struggled to find any visible pixels., They're just too small., While the Captivate's screen technology was top-notch in many scenarios, the Apple iPhone 4's Retina display experience was overall the most realistic and lifelike display we've ever encountered in the smartphone world, and needs to be experienced to be believed., iPhone 4 iOS 4 Experience

Apple has renamed the traditional iPhone OS to iOS, which is geared to work across the full spectrum of Apple products including the iPod and iPad., That also means synchronization across all Apple products, so if you download an eBook or game on the iPad, you can sync it to your phone, and vice versa., As far as email, we get Exchange support, as well as IMAP and POP3., We could also check all of our mail via a unified inbox that showed multiple accounts in the same stream., Multitasking for select types of functionality is also part of the deal., With an Apple A4 processor and 512MB of RAM, the iPhone 4 flies through operations and handles multiple tasks at once., What happens is that the iPhone 4 ironically gets a limited version of a feature Windows Mobile has had for nearly a decade, where it'll freeze an application or program, keeping it in a background cache for future use., We were able to rifle between applications thanks to the bottom Application bar that can be accessed from anywhere by tapping the Home button., We could also listen to music in the background while performing various tasks like web browsing or playing games, thanks to third-party applications like Pandora., GPS can be kept running while performing other tasks and Skype or VoIP calls can be answered while doing other things., We were very impressed with Apple's iOS experience., It's highly intuitive and takes the previous version of the OS to a new level of productivity and efficiency., However, we're still married to the proprietary world of Apple-branded features., For instance, there was no way to set a custom Ringtone or Notification tone unless we dropped some cash or went the jailbreak route., On for instance the Samsung Captivate, we could just drag and drop any sound we wanted onto the microSD card and assign numerous different sounds to different actions., Hopefully Apple will do something about this in the future., Check out iPhone 4 specifications., iPhone 4 FaceTime

Let's talk about the Apple iPhone 4's camera configuration., We've got a 5-megapixel CMOS shooter in the back and a 1.3-megapixel VGA cam in the front for FaceTime chats and self-portraits., The camera on the back has an LED flash that functions as a video light while recording 720p video or any other quality., We get down and dirty with the cameras a few sections down, so we're going to focus mainly on FaceTime, which is Apple's version of in-phone Web chat via Wi-Fi., We used FaceTime and were satisfied with how clear the subject was and the refined motion., There was no frame lagging, and we could hold conversations clearly, thanks to the dual-mic noise suppression., Unlike a laptop, FaceTime also gave us the freedom to roam around the house, taking our FaceTime buddies with us., iPhone 4 Multimedia and Voice Quality

We know that Netflix is heading Apple's way, which will open up the floodgates to downloadable content via wireless or 3G networks, and we still have Apple's omnipotent App Store for thousands of games, tools, and other miscellaneous applications., Speaking of gaming, the Apple iPhone 4 has a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer for improved game control., We loaded Need for Speed on the iPhone 4 and Rolling Thunder on the Samsung Captivate and iOS 4 proved to be better optimized for such a task than Android 2.1., We also enjoyed watching movies on the iPhone 4, despite not offering the latest and greatest display technology on the market., Now for voice quality, we tested the iPhone by calling the Samsung Captivate., Both phones are in the same arena, and it is a good one., Apple's dual-mic noise suppression led to a background-free talk experience, even by a busy road., We were impressed by the clarity and lack of static., And about the antenna issue, we never had an issue with the iPhone 4's antenna?in fact, reception was great., Still, it's worth noting that Apple will provide iPhone 4 buyers with a free case as of late July, which should alleviate this issue if appearing., Another one of Apple's claims centered around battery life?as always., Being packed with high-end technology in a compact body, what usually ends up happening is we see the same battery lifespan every round of new phones., iPhone 4 Still Image Quality

The Apple iPhone 4's camera is one of its feature attractions., We've got a 5-megapixel 720p HD CMOS image sensor with 1.75-micron BSI pixel architecture geared to improve low-light sensitivity., We found the iPhone 4's camera to be pretty good, though we could discern a few tricks., First off, colors are vibrant, to the point of almost being neon at times, so saturation is undoubtedly pumped., There's also a lot of internal sharpening going on, giving us a defined image at the cost of boosted noise in low light., The saturation and vibrant color reproduction came to the iPhone 4's aid in low light, though certain images were pelted with black noise., However, the iPhone 4 could expose where many other popular phones couldn't., We also experienced an excellent handling of motion while shooting out of a moving car and the phone's LED flash provided a significant illumination boost., It's worth noting that the Camera mode is strictly stripped down to the ability to tap Focus., When you tap, you are essentially adjusting the Focus, Exposure, White Balance, and ISO, so it's more of an Auto/Manual hybrid tool., While the Samsung Captivate provides a wealth of filters, effects, manual controls, and shooting modes, the iPhone 4 relies on 3rd party Camera applications to get the job done., We would have liked a nice suite of manual controls to go with this nice sensor, but Apple's aim is simplicity, and for a camera that can point, tap, and shoot with great results nine out of ten times, the iPhone 4's camera is still great in terms of image quality., Bike Graveyard

That back-illuminated CMOS sensor rocked the Casbah in video mode., Recording drunken shenanigans in dimly lit bars is a smaller task for the iPhone 4 than you'd think, especially with its LED video light., We were greeted to smooth motion with no lag or frame jumping, and we actually checked the frame rate, which showed 29.97fps, a video standard., The competing Samsung Captivate's videos showed at 29.55fps, which led to some motion lag on its end., iMovie is also available for the iPhone 4 for five bucks, allowing users to edit their videos right in the phone and send them off as text messages to friends., Videos and still images can also be geotagged, pinpointing the exact location they were captured or snapped., iPhone 4 Low Light Videos, Apple iPhone 4: The Final Answer

Between the iPhone 4's image quality, beautiful Retina display, Web chat capability, multitasking in the revamped iOS 4, delicious build quality, and Roadrunner-quick operation, this is as close as you can get to the top of the entertainment totem pole., But we didn't like the same proprietary Ringtone/Notification corner we were backed into, and feel that we should have the choice to set a Legend of Zelda magic sound every time we get an email or edit our own version of the Reading Rainbow theme as our ringtone., Apple should also have done a better job at giving iOS 4 a boost into the future as far as Web service integration is concerned., Last year's Motorola Droid slammed free Google Maps turn-by-turn navigation on the table., Furthermore, we'll soon see a BlackBerry Bold 9800 QWERTY touch slider powered by BlackBerry 6 being launched on AT&T that integrates corporate Gmail., In the early days of the iPhone, being the leader in taking advantage of for instance new Google services were one of its merits., We're sure Apple has a plan for the future as far as Web services are concerned, and we're confident that iTunes and App Store will keep improving., However, 2010 will not be remembered as a year when Apple really nailed it in the smartphone world., It'll primarily be remembered as a year when Apple spent most of its resources getting up to speed on  previous shortcomings., Naturally, the iPhone 4's much asked for features are as important as any for devoted iPhone users, and as such, it's a great addition to the smartphone market for many people (along with the $100 iPhone 3GS 8GB)., However, as a "Jesus phone", it simply falls short as there are now other smartphones out there that also deliver features that people didn't know they wanted., If you're looking for a top-notch entertainment device, we can safely recommend the iPhone 4, but if you're looking for the latest and greatest smartphone, you won't necessarily find it in the iPhone 4., iPhone 4 Photo Gallery, Price and Availability

The iPhone 4 is available for AT&T now., It sells for $300 with a new two-year contract., A $100 mail-in rebate will be given when signing up for a qualifying plan., The iPhone 4 is also available for $600 unlocked, and a white version will start shipping later this year., In late July, Apple will also start offering a free bumper to iPhone 4 customers., Also, if you're not happy with your iPhone 4 experience, undamaged units can be returned within 30 days of purchase for a full refund., Starting July 30, the iPhone 4 will be available in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Singapore, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland., ?

Copyright 1999-2010 ? infoSync World, those shots of the comparison between the Super AMOLED and IPS LCD are weird based on the brightness?
The browser on the Galaxy S has a Separate brightness setting that you have to turn up apart from the System brightness., amir_rafie Jun 29th, 2010, engadget made the same mistake & after that they corrected it:
http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/24/iphone-4-retina-display-vs-galaxy-s-super-amoled-fight/
everybody knows that engadget is the fan of apple, we trust on slashgear only , I wish slashgear won`t deviate with steve jobs`s money!, amir_rafie Jun 29th, 2010, would you compare the screens in the direct sunlight?, (with maximum brightness that set in the browser), This review is absolutely bias!, The display comparison in this review is between the iPhone 4G and ?HTC EVO 4G? not the ?Samsung Galaxy S (with the Super AMOLED)?., The HTC EVO uses TFT screen, not an AMOLED screen, never mind super AMOLED display., The reviewer doesn?t know the differences between the phones., I don?t think he knows anything., You can clearly see the ?HTC? on the second phone, but the reviewer is a little thick to see it., Either he?s thick, or he?s trying to con us??, This whole site is marketing ?tool? for Apple., I wonder how far the reviewer (who sounds camp btw) and the Editor got their heads up Steve Jobs a**!, Ok so apple made another gorgeous looking device, but can you really say it is a strong contender for cellphone of 2010., Besides the display what has apple done to merit the device award that others have not already done., IOS4 now sort of has multitasking, while others have had true multitasking for years, it has a forward facing camera with video chat(wifi only) the evo had that first(in the US) and can be done on 3g and 4g, oh yeah and the evo has 4g which I think is more of a cellphone milestone., I?m not trying to sound like a hater, but I guess I don?t get what apple really has done here besides play catch-up and finally change their design, which has proven to be a major flaw., Now I know why no other cell manufacturer has put the antenna on the outside of the phone, it won?t make calls., The phone still doesn?t function well as a phone, a huge problem for people that actually talk on their cell phones?maybe the phone never being attached to a cell site allows for such great battery life., I think the phone looks great but it?s not a game changer like the original and they are only doing what other companies have already done and trying to act like they are the first., No need to hate me for this, and I would love to hear people?s thoughts on what I?m missing here, since I?m not already hooked to apple and att like 77% of all iphone 4 sales went to people upgrading., You guys made the same mistake like Engadget reviewers with comparisson of screens of iPhone 4 and Samsung Galaxy S!!!, Well, as you pros should know or see others making that mistake, brightness on Galaxy S is separately regulated within browser., Are you sponsored by iRetina crew?!?!, Upload the new photos to retain your creadibility?, Nice review., I?m based in London UK and don?t get the constant dropped calls, is that the same with all AT&T?s phones?, What I do get though is reception going to zero and calls dropped that way when I hold the phone the way Apple tell us we shouldn?t (it?s the way I?ve always held phones)., For Slashgear to dismiss this fundamental issue as ?not a deal breaker? is ludicrous when reviewing a PHONE., I can see why others believe there may be a bias towards Apple in this review., This phone is very similar to my 2year old 3G but with a better screen, camera and is slightly faster., istariphoenix Jul 16th, 2010, It?s amazing how badly iPhone 4 sucks., It?s also amazing how Apple Fanboys will defend it until the end of time., I will freely note first off that I am not a fanboy by any stretch, however I do have the 3GS, which I love., I did buy the iPhone 4, and it was so terrible that I returned it and went back to my current 3GS., It was just that bad., It?s hilarious to me what Apple fanboys are saying in forums and blogs all across the web, defending this thing like it?s some sacred gem, pretending all its issues don?t even exist., Check out the video I made on YouTube about ?An Apple Fanboy?s take on Life??., It?s at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcQ-cYg8iA, led flash!, easy 2 use ui!, Ability to recognize 10 fingers +1!, 3rd party apps dat support flash!, wat remains!, now b4 u lash out!, i wud rather get d galaxy s!, But i ask u 2 judge fairly!, ders no amount of brightness tweaking dat will make d galaxy s look better in terms of display!, majority of ppl just want a shinny new toy easy 2use., i knw a couple o peeps who dont do a single thing with powerful fones but recieve call., Apple are excellent business folks!, they aim 4 beauty, sales and efficiency(fluidity) rather than other thns!, Note dat 77% of ppl are block headed stark raving retarded idiots and those r who Apple aim 4!, like it or not they make their money!, Galaxy S is separately regulated within browser., Are you sponsored by iRetina crew?!?!, Apple iPhone 4 makes the most awaited video calling a reality with its face time feature., And the Retina display gives the highest resolution display ever., And to keep that display for long blueunplugged introduces you to the amazing Apple iPhone 4 accessories at the unbeatable prices., So cease all you need for your iPhone 4 and keep it in its best working condition for years to come?? Latest From The Mobile Fanatics.http://ridakami.blogspot.com/??http://ridakami.blogspot.com/, Click here to cancel reply., Block-circling queues, midnight campers and stores with all the stock wrung out of them: it can only be a new iPhone., Apple?s iPhone 4 has landed and it?s taking no prisoners., Packing the freshly-released iOS4 with a slimmed-down, powered-up hardware, as ever the promise is not so much ticks on the spec sheet but a superlative user experience., Is the iPhone 4 another home run, or ? in a market of rivals it helped motivate ? has Apple lost its edge?, Check out the full SlashGear review after the cut., Hardware
This fourth-generation hardware marks a significant design departure for Apple, eschewing the curved plastic of the last couple of iPhones and replacing it with glass, metal and squared off edges., The fascia is a single sheet of toughened Gorilla Glass, supposedly 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic is, while the outer bezel is stainless steel and integrates the GSM/UMTS, GPS, WiFi and Bluetooth antennas for improved performance., At 4.8oz in the hand it?s solid and pleasantly weighty, while Apple?s opting for a non-user-accessible battery means there?s no battery door to creak or flex., Hardware controls are limited to a power/sleep button on the top edge, a ringer switch on the top left hand side, volume up/down buttons just beneath it and the usual home key under the display., On the bottom edge is the dock connector, flanked by two speaker grills, while a 3.5mm headphone jack sits up on the top., The front-facing camera is just visible alongside the speaker grill, while on the back is the main camera and the new LED flash above the traditional shiny Apple logo., The SIM slot ? now taking a smaller microSIM like the iPad WiFi + 3G ?  has moved from the top edge to the right side, and there are now two  microphones, one on top and one on the bottom, used for noise  cancellation., All in all it?s slimmer and slicker than the iPhone 3GS it replaces, and neatly distinct from much of its rivals on the market., Best of all, perhaps, it?s very obviously a new handset; the 3GS came in for some criticism by virtue of its being physically identical to the 3G, leaving those who had upgraded with no visible sign that they?d done so., That may sound shallow, but it?s nonetheless a real consideration for many consumers and will help differentiate the iPhone 4 in-store., Retina Display
Turn the handset on, however, and you all but forget the physical design: Apple?s so-called Retina Display is eye-wateringly impressive, setting a new bar in smartphone screens performance., According to Apple?s official stats, it?s a 960 x 640 3.5-inch IPS LCD panel with 326 pixels per inch, an 800:1 contrast ratio and 500 cd/m2 brightness., As before there?s an oleophobic oil-resistant coating ? that?s applied to the back of the iPhone 4 too ? which, while the handset is still prone to picking up prints, means it?s an easy matter to wipe them off again., Specs aside, the iPhone 4?s display is frankly the best mobile display on the market so far., AMOLED/Super AMOLED advocates will likely argue which technology has the better contrast, richer colors or inkiest blacks, but the real magic is in the extreme pixel density., On stage at WWDC 2010, Steve Jobs described Retina Display as having more pixels than the eye can see, marketing hyperbole that prompted another round of arguments, but in short, at the kind of average distance most users hold their handsets at, the individual pixels are simply too small to be differentiated between., Galaxy S brightness still falls short of iPhone 4?s Retina Display., Samsung Galaxy S: 4-in Super-AMOLED (above)

iPhone 4 vs Galaxy S in direct sunlight (unedited)

Retina Display allows for much better viewing than Super AMOLED when viewed through a pair of Polarized sunglasses., Brightness on MAXIMUM for both devices

As you might expect, that has a huge impact on graphics and text., Even the basic iOS4 homescreen, familiar now to anyone with an iPhone 3G or 3GS, looks rejuvenated, with icons crisp and detailed., Load up the browser, meanwhile, and that pixel density means ? as long as your eyesight is up to it ? you can make out text at far lesser levels of zoom than on the last generation handset., It?s a little like moving from a small-screen phone to one of the current breed of 4.3-inch devices like the HTC EVO 4G or forthcoming 4-inch Super AMOLED Samsung Galaxy S, and discovering you can see much more of a webpage at the default zoom than you could before, only far better., Developers using the new iOS4 SDK will be able to rework their apps to take advantage of all those extra pixels, but Apple has built in some intelligent rendering so that non-updated software doesn?t look entirely bad., Still, it?s a good incentive for updates, particularly in games which look, frankly, stunning on the iPhone 4., Connectivity
Connectivity remains broad, with a few key changes over the 3GS; there?s still quadband 850/900/1900/2100 UMTS/HSPA and quadband GSM/EDGE, together with Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, WiFi b/g/n (though only single band 2.4GHz 802.11n, not dual-band like the Apple Airport Express supports) and A-GPS., As before there?s a digital compass and accelerometer, plus proximity and ambient light sensors that control the iPhone?s display during use, but Apple has also slotted in a three-axis gyroscope., This allows for far more precise interpretation of what orientation in 3D-space the iPhone 4 is being held in, and was well received by game developers at WWDC 2010., There?s still no standard USB 2.0 port, only the proprietary Apple Dock Connector, and still no expandable memory slot., Two versions of the iPhone 4 will be offered, as with the last-gen 3GS, with either 16GB or 32GB of storage (a ?new? 8GB 3GS has been slotted in as the $99 entry-level handset)., We?ve a feeling Apple buyers are used to the absence of, say, a microSD card slot, and we?re not entirely sure where on the iPhone 4 it could have been accommodated, but it?s something to bear in mind if you?re wanting to take advantage of the Retina Display?s excellence at playing high-bitrate video., Inside, squeezed into the narrower chassis, is the same Apple A4 processor as powers the iPad., In addition to the 1GHz chip they?ve also doubled the RAM, which is now 512MB rather than the 256MB of the iPad and iPhone 3GS., The end result is, unsurprisingly, the fastest iPhone to-date, whipping between homescreen pages, booting apps in record time, and generally being lag-free., Camera
While they may have protested otherwise, photography has always been a weak point in iPhone handsets (though that hasn?t stopped owners from making hefty use of the camera)., Happily the iPhone 4 marks a significant step up on that front., There are now two cameras: one, a 5-megapixel unit with autofocus and a single LED flash, on the back for general photography and video recording, and the second, a VGA-quality camera embedded in the front of the smartphone, and used for video calls., As we?re seeing from other manufacturers of late, Apple has signed up to the ?it?s not just megapixels? message, pointing to other factors like sensor size and lens quality as just as ? or more ? important., While at 5-megapixels it?s not the highest resolution camera in a smartphone on the market ? there are several with 8MP, and Nokia?s N8 will bring 12MP when it launches later this year ? Apple say they?ve made sure pictures benefit from careful design rather than plumping for the biggest sensor that could fit in., It?s a decision that shows in the end results, with still photos being a significant step up from what the 3GS could produce., Not only are colors and detail more accurate, but there?s less of the cellphone ?fuzz? that often works as a giveaway that a cameraphone?s smaller lens was involved., Even without the LED flash, low-light performance is noticeably stronger, with indoor and evening shots losing their murkiness., The LED flash itself is, like most of its ilk, of limited benefit; there?s a relatively narrow sweet-spot in terms of range that, outside of which, images are either over- or under-illuminated, but it?s serviceable all the same., Controls still err on the side of simplicity, with touch-to-focus control, a 5x digital zoom, manual flash settings (that basically amount to on/off and auto) and a shutter release button; we?d love to see a dedicated hardware camera key, since we imagine the iPhone 4 is going to replace a lot more dedicated digicams., Thanks to the boosted processor speed, both loading up the camera app and actually taking pictures is faster than before, and there?s less chance that you?ll miss the shot waiting for the iPhone to catch up., 720p HD video recording is also supported, with Apple claiming full 30fps framerates, and you can use the LED flash as a video light., This proved roughly on a par with one of the point-and-shoot camcorders available from Flip, Kodak and others, though you?ll need a steady hand since there?s no image stabilization., $4.99 gets you iMovie for iPhone from the App Store, the mobile version of Apple?s video editing app, complete with a finger-friendly interface, various transitions, themes, effects and titling options., It?s unlikely to replace your use of the desktop version, but for trimming and combining a few clips for a mobile upload to YouTube it?s surprisingly usable., If anything, though, we do think Apple should have bundled iMovie with the iPhone 4 as Nokia are doing with their N8 video editing app, and it?s worth noting that the app exports in .MOV format which may need converting to play on devices outside of Apple?s ecosystem., iPhone 4 sample 720p HD videos, Face Time
The front camera, meanwhile, is designed for Apple?s new strike at the video calling market, something many others have attempted to kick-start and have had, for the most part, little success., Called FaceTime, the new app is currently exclusive to the iPhone 4, and is neatly integrated into the standard apps., Tapping the FaceTime button in Contacts starts a video call straight away, or you can switch from a regular cellular voice call to FaceTime midway through (though not, it?s worth noting, in the other direction)., There are a few provisos, as you might imagine for a new system, and which if it weren?t for Apple?s market appeal we might question FaceTime?s likelihood of success., First off is that you?ll need a WiFi network in order for FaceTime to work, since right now Apple won?t let video calls be made over cellular connections., That seems to be a decision based on network bandwidth, with Apple giving the carriers time to get their systems up to scratch; Steve Jobs hinted that the 3G situation may be reconsidered in 2011, though it?s possible that Apple could build in carrier opt-out as we?ve seen them do with tethering., Second, the person you?re calling will have to have an iPhone 4 themselves, since so far FaceTime only works on that one handset., Apple are opening up the APIs in the hope that other companies will pick them up and build in compatibility to their own devices, but that, again, will likely take some time., Of course, with record-breaking numbers of iPhone 4 pre-orders over the past week or so ? and no sign of demand slowing down ? there?s a good chance you may know someone out there with one of their own, so that compatibility question may not apply., In practice, the FaceTime experience feels a lot like iChat on the desktop ? or, indeed, like video calling in Europe or Asia where the functionality has been available, cross-platform, for years now ? with the screen dominated by the person you?re talking to and your own face in a PIP inset in the top corner., While defaulting to the front-facing camera, you can toggle between that and the rear camera ? though not at the full 5-megapixel resolution ? to show your surroundings, and FaceTime works in both landscape and portrait orientations., Image quality was reasonable over a broad WiFi connection, though when we tried using a MiFi-style mobile 3G router as a bridge we did notice some visual artifacts breaking in., We?re more than a little confused why Apple didn?t build in iChat desktop support, though, which would?ve instantly made the iPhone 4 more appealing as part of an existing ecosystem., iOS4
The iPhone 4?s other headline software features have, ironically, been scooped by the iOS4 update Apple pushed out to the iPhone 3GS (and, less so, the 3G and iPod touch) late last week., The new version of iOS brings with it Apple?s answer to some of the more persistent criticisms of its mobile range, including multitasking support and a unified inbox, and if you?re a 3GS owner who finds iOS4?s feature list satisfies most complaints you have with your cellphone, you might find trying out the (free) update for a while saves you the cost of upgrading to the iPhone 4., As you might expect, given Apple?s vocal objection to multitasking in previous years, iOS4 handles multiple apps somewhat differently to how rival platforms approach it., Their argument has been that battery life suffers to an unacceptable degree when software is running in the background; hence on the iPhone 4 background apps aren?t in fact operational but are frozen in the state you left them., In effect it?s a type of caching, packaged with a handful of new APIs that developers can take advantage of., Those APIs allow for background audio, such as in streaming media apps like Pandora, to continue, as well as task completion, where uploads or syncs are finished even if you switch away from the app before it?s done., There?s also background GPS, which keeps navigation-centric apps updated with positioning data, and background VoIP, which allows apps such as Skype to stay on the look out for new incoming calls without having to be active all the time., The new caching and APIs are packaged together with an app switching dialog that, when you double-press the home button, pops up at the bottom of the display and allows you to flick between recently used titles., Of course there?s also the existing push notification system that triggers pop-ups when server-linked apps have a new update., It works well, overall, though the biggest drawback is that none of the new multitasking functionality is native; apps must be coded specially to take advantage of the APIs and of the caching., Without that support, the software will show up in the app switcher but you?ll be back to square one each time you return to it., iPhone 4 demo, In effect, it?s a balance: a decision Apple has made between battery capacity and functionality users are used to from rival platforms., Barring rapid increases in battery technology, we can?t see them opening up ?true? multitasking ? where apps are left to run free and untended in the background ? any time soon., For some that will be a deal breaker and push them toward webOS, Android or other platforms; for many, it will be sufficiently advanced that ? with a little developer ingenuity to make best use of the APIs and other systems on offer ? they may not notice the difference., You?ll certainly notice the difference with unified messaging in the iOS4 Mail app, and it kicks the iPhone 4 back into play with the best of email-centric smartphones., Hard to believe that it?s taken Apple so long to add a combined inbox, but now, as well as viewing each account separately, you can see one view with all new messages., There?s also conversation support: a small number appears to the right of a message in the inbox if there are subsequent replies to it, and tapping to view pulls out all of those replies into a single, easier to follow string., With the App Store now containing in excess of 200,000 titles, homescreen folders are ironically more useful than they sound., Drag any app icon onto another and a folder is automatically created, named by default according to the app?s category, but open to user customization too., Go heavy on the organization and you can quickly slim down 10+ full homescreen panes to just a couple of screens of folders., Curiously, though, Apple has limited each folder to just twelve apps, and there?s no support for nested folders: putting in a sub-folder to separate out, say, card games from your gaming folder., It?s not the only place we?d like to see improvement, either., iOS4?s app switching system is slick ? the side-scrolling app manager bar is straightforward to use, and holding down on an icon lets you close it directly ? but that only goes to highlight the frustrating pop-up notifications., With more and more apps running in the background and wanting to alert users to new updates, messages and status changes, it?s increasingly likely that whatever you?re doing will be punctuated at least once or twice with an on-screen dialog box., Unlike on rival platforms like Android or webOS, there?s no way to ?ignore? the alert but still have it visible so as to remind you later on that something has changed: instead you have to deal with it there and then, or dismiss it altogether., We?d also like to see an iPhone 4 version of iPhoto, or at least some basic image editing tools on the handset., iMovie has shown that the 1GHz CPU is capable of HD video editing, so being unable to crop or tweak shots in the iPhone 4?s gallery seems particularly shortsighted., It?s worth noting that the smartphone is reliant on iPhoto on the desktop to handle facial recognition and galleries: you?ll need to set them up there and then sync to get them across onto the iPhone 4., Finally, we wish Apple would broaden its social networking integration, so that as well as emailing or MMS?ing images from the gallery we could upload them to Flickr, Facebook or other online galleries., That links in with a general shortage of social network awareness in iOS4 as standard; yes, there are apps which will tick those boxes, but they lack the wholehearted system integration that we?ve seen on rival platforms., Performance
As was made clear by the inevitable teardown, a fair amount of the iPhone 4?s chassis is taken up by its battery: in this case a 1,420 mAh Li-Polymer pack., Apple reckon you?ll see up to 300hrs standby, up to 7hrs 3G talktime or up to 14hrs 2GB talktime from a full charge, or alternatively up to 6hrs 3G internet browsing, 10hrs over WiFi, 10hrs of video playback or 40hrs of audio., In reality we?ve found the fourth-gen handset manages around 25-percent longer runtime than its predecessor, with mixed use., For instance, after around six minutes of voice calls, replying to thirty-odd emails and twenty minutes of RSS reading, the iPhone 4 dropped from 100-percent to 90-percent., Still, it?s relatively early days yet, and we?ll be watching closely to see how the iPhone 4 performs over the next week or so before revisiting battery life., We?ll also be keeping track of how AT&T handles calls and whether the improvements ? both that Apple has made to the iPhone 4 and the carrier claims to have made to their network ? make a significant impact., Poor voice call performance has been an ongoing criticism of all three prior generations of iPhone,  a persistent thorn in Apple?s performance paw., For their part, Apple claim to have changed the way the smartphone prioritizes network selection, with the iPhone 4 picking a base station band not solely on signal strength but on available capacity., That way, the company reckons, users won?t be faced with the confusing situation where the iPhone says it has a strong signal but calls drop nonetheless., That change in measurement has made it difficult to gauge the extent to which our iPhone 4 demonstrates the same antenna issues as have been widely reported and which Apple has acknowledged., In short, the switch to making the antennas external has meant that, if a user?s hand bridges the two and is sufficiently damp to prove conductive, the iPhone 4 can lose signal dramatically., It?s certainly something we can replicate, though we had to hold the handset in a way we wouldn?t usually do., Apple?s own Bumper case is one workaround, and it seems a physical case is generally the best solution; adhesive strips, like Fusion of Ideas? StealthArmor, failed to address the signal problem as they were billed as doing., Now, some iPhone 4 owners are finding they naturally hold the handset in a way that doesn?t cause problems, or that their specific phone isn?t as prone to it anyway, but many are discovering they also need to budget for a case., No matter the changes, AT&T?s network continues to frustrate., We?ve suffered multiple dropped calls in every day of iPhone 4 use with the US carrier, and as before there?s little apparent connection between what?s shown in the status bar and what the network is actually capable of sustaining., Even more frustrating, perhaps, are the recurring ?No SIM? errors in which the iPhone 4 and the AT&T MicroSIM seemingly become bored and stop responding to each other., We?re not sure whether it?s an Apple hardware issue ? we?re seeing similar reports from multiple people, though predominantly in the US ? or something to do with the carrier?s systems, but either way it demands a power-cycle before the two play nicely again., When you do manage to place a call, there?s an impressive improvement in audio quality., The iPhone 4?s dual microphones ? used for active noise cancellation ? left callers able to hear us even with traffic in the background., Meanwhile the speakerphone is also louder than on the 3GS, thanks, we?re guessing, to the new audio chamber also spotted in the teardown., Even so, you get a sense that Apple have tuned the iPhone 4 for data use, unsurprising perhaps given the number of apps that rely on network connectivity., There?s a significant improvement in 3G speeds over the iPhone 3GS that?s noticeable in day to day use, and the iPhone 4 is proving one of the fastest browsing devices on AT&T?s network that we?ve experienced., Outside of the US, meanwhile, Apple has opened its arms to embrace not only multiple carrier partners but official unlocked devices, seemingly deciding that if you can?t beat the unlockers then you may as well join them., In the UK and Canada, among other places, carriers are offering the iPhone 4 on subsidized deals while Apple themselves are selling unlocked, SIM-free (and full price) handsets., It?s a move that we can only see fueling the call for broader availability in the US, though without knowing the exact specifics of Apple?s exclusivity deal with AT&T it?s hard to say whether it?s a shift we can expect to see any time soon., Accessories
As for accessories, we?ve been trying out Apple?s iPhone 4 Dock which ? as you might expect ? works to charge and sync the smartphone, and also has a 3.5mm audio output for hooking up to your stereo., Thanks to the change in case shape, however, you won?t be able to use a 3GS in the dock, even though the Dock Connector port is the same., The official Bumper, meanwhile, is more a rubber band than it is a true case: both the front and back are left entirely exposed, with the Bumper stretching around the stainless steel band alone., In a neat touch, the Bumper doesn?t just use cut-outs for the volume and power buttons, but actually has integrated metal keys that press the true buttons underneath., We?re not entirely sure how much protection it will give, but given they cut out any reception issues based on how you hold the iPhone 4, we can see Bumpers being a popular accessory., They and the iPhone 4 Dock are $29 each., Wrap-up
The lingering question remains: despite the Steve Jobs hype and the Apple marketing, does the iPhone 4 continue to innovate or has the increasingly competitive smartphone market caught up to Cupertino?s finest?, There?s no denying that, while the first-generation iPhone caught rivals unprepared, the segment as a whole has accelerated hugely in the intervening period., For consumers that?s hardly a bad thing, of course, though the record-breaking sales (1.7m iPhone 4 to be exact) and huge queues indicate there?s still a huge demand for Apple?s offering., That demand, and the support of the developer community, are a significant aspect in Apple?s favor., A good example is the gyroscope, new to the iPhone 4 but lacking any native software that actually makes use of it: Apple is able to bundle that feature and know that third-party app producers will make it shine., Many may protest at the heavily curated nature of the App Store, but to consumers it offers the promise that whatever they load shouldn?t leave their phone unstable., It?s an element that, even as Android Market content rises in number, Google can?t quite promise to users of their OS., Factor in what?s undoubtedly an attractive, appealing piece of hardware with excellent imaging skills, sufficient processor grunt to power the latest apps and games, and a display that puts most others to shame, and you?re getting to a very tempting package., At the launch of the iPhone 3GS, the difficult question was whether 3G owners should upgrade to the new, faster device, and many couldn?t quite justify the move., With the iPhone 4, however, it?s a more clean-cut choice: yes, you can get much of the iOS4 experience on your existing iPhone, but there?s also the brilliant Retina Display, far better camera and ? antenna holding issues aside ? improved wireless performance on offer from the new device., Apple knows it can?t afford to rest on its laurels ? and they have to blame themselves in part for that; their own success has been a significant factor in driving the smartphone market ? and the hardware capabilities of the iPhone 4 are part of a multi-stage approach that sees software releases as important as the physical device you sign a contract for., Our criticisms ? such as the absence of photo editing or social network integration ?  are predominantly aspects that could be addressed in future iterations of iOS4, and it would be naive to assume Apple isn?t already looking at where next to take the platform., Out of the box, though, the iPhone 4 is one of the most polished, appealing smartphones on the market today., By boosting the camera, upgrading the screen and generally tightening up the whole user experience, Apple has neatly answered most of the complaints from previous models together with addressing some ? like the Retina Display ? we didn?t even know we had., The antenna issue is frustrating, certainly, but unlikely to be a deal-breaker, and the improvement in battery life is more than welcome; moreover, there?s something inherent in the iPhone 4 that goes beyond ?just another? phone and demands you engage with it., Apple?s approach to mobile continues to polarize opinion, but for those with the acquired taste the iPhone 4 is Cupertino?s best yet and a strong contender for smartphone of 2010., Unboxing iPhone 4, With a high resolution display, a glass back, and even a gyroscope can the new Apple iPhone retain its smartphone crown?, as reviewed, The latest version of Apple's iconic touchscreen smartphone is now available and it brings with it a whole host of new and innovative features., Is it worthy successor to its forebears the iPhone, iPhone 3G, and iPhone 3GS and, more to the point, is it worth its high asking price or should you hold out for the next round of Android, Windows 7, Meego, or WebOS devices?, Read on to find out., Most striking about the iPhone 4 is its new design., While the front is classic iPhone with its single piece of glass, single button, and symmetrical black bezel, the back has moved away from the curves of old to be replaced by a completely flat sheet of aluminosilicate-toughened glass (what do you mean you haven't heard of it?!)., Combined with the new flat stainless steel sides, this gives the phone a particularly industrial, minimalist look and feel that is sure to split opinion even more than existing iPhones have., To our minds the concept is sound and we really like the exceptional fit and finish of the phone but certainly the front bezel does now look a bit tired., In particular this seems to be because the iPhone 4 is slightly narrower and taller, yet retains the same size screen, as previous models., This makes the screen look a bit lost in the vast blackness of that bezel., It's still a pretty stunning design overall but there's definitely a prototype/engineering sample feel that takes the edge off., By severely shrinking many of the internal components, Apple has managed to make the iPhone 4 noticeably slimmer than its forebears at just 9.3mm, and the company even touts it as the slimmest smartphone., Normally we would be concerned about this as the slimmer devices get, the more difficult they tend to be to handle but thanks to its flat sides the iPhone 4 is actually pretty easy to get a good grip on., However, the pointy edges that result from all those flat surfaces make the phone feel, if not out and out uncomfortable, certainly less comfy than many rivals and even previous iPhones., Weight remains largely unchanged at 137g, 2g more than the iPhone 3GS., Another potential pitfall of having so much glass is its propensity to crack or shatter when knocked., However we've never experienced any such problems with any existing iPhone screens (though we have heard reports) so we see no reason why the glass front and back of the iPhone 4 should suffer unduly., Indeed, Apple has been quite happy to bash phones on tables and floors in various demonstrations we've seen and they've all remained spotless., Moreover, in our experience, unlike plastic, glass screens are essentially scratch proof in normal use so using glass on the back as well will hopefully mean the iPhone 4 will look flawless for years to come, no matter how rough you treat it., Certainly we know many people that have not been overly careful yet own three year old iPhones that don't have a single scratch on the screen, which is more than can be said of the aluminium and plastic backs of said phones., Feed for this Entry, ikaw pala yung binanggit ni digital

for 40-50k more u get gsm 3.5g, 5mp cam & 256mb ram?
that?s it?!?!, i think it should only add 5k more? no wonder iphone fanbois are screwed!, and to think 90% of all great apps are games!, i heart ipod touch 4g!, not nexth month Yuga, next week it will be here officially, If you happen to know  someone who lives in HK you can have them order the iPhone online from the Hong Kong Apple Store., It comes out to aroubd PhP35k ?only? for an unlocked phone!, Just have them ship it here one they get it or have hem bring it over when they come back (sa HK address lang kasi pwede i-deliver, and 3 weeks yung waiting time)., Just to clarify my statement, the 35k price is for the 32gb model., I wouldn?t suggest having it shipped here, malamang maiipit sa customs., Better have someone handcarry it back nalang., i used to have the 3g then i sold it bcos theres really no modern features on it, then i bought a cheaper more feature pack phone called the samsung wave, yah its really a feature pack phone a good camera a wonderful screen u can even watch movies without the time consuming effort of converting every movies u downloaded, but as time goes by something is telling me that i dont really need a super packed phone, and then i came to realized that intuitiveness and a fast ui really makes the experience a lot more enjoyable, my problem with the wave is it doesnt have text reflow like the iphone, its always hard to read the text from any web page i opened and the implimentation of facebook is just crap, just try it and ull know what i really mean, but i have to agree its really a very expensive toy to have, if this phone comes to globe with a tag price of 35-37k(16gb) ill definitely buy it maybe theres a reason why globe havent release it yet(antenna issue, as we all know apple is giving free cases for the iphone until sept 30, hmm so meaning the new batch that globe will acquire have no issues), @yuga: sir correct ko lang po yung toggle above the volume keys does not control the auto-rotate function ng iphone., it is used to turn the silent mode on., pwede po i-access ung control for auto-rotate by pressing the home button twice thus launching the multi-tasking basr and scroll to the farthest left after the music controls., iphone 4 is hands-down the best phone i have ever used due to its simplicity of use and a wide selection of apps., i have used a motorola milestone and the android os is a bit slower compared to the ios., the iphone4?s retina display is truly amazing talo ang old generation iphones., but yes may reception issues nga but it is hardly felt pag masyadong tight lang ang grip sa lower left handside ng phone., what makes it a winner is the ability to entertain with the apps, games, music, video player, camera (which is very good by the way) and social networking., must hold it in person as pictures dont do justice., I just still recommend Samsung Wave..This is a great phone!!, superb screen display (Super AMOLED), promising OS (Bada) and Samsung Apps, fast processor(1Ghz), clear 5MP camera and HD video, wifi/internet connectivity (HSPA,3G), solid/unique design, and at a reasonable price., So yeah? Based on feedbacks on this site, confirmed na for at least P45,000, you?re paying for a defective calling device., In addition, walang micro SD slot, and it doesn?t support Flash content of websites., One more thing?

Ibig sabihin, hindi gagana dito yung dati kong SIM Card ko na matagal ko nang ginagamit?, Phones are expensive because it is on a cartel and connivance with telcos., The actual/true price of a phone is when it gets subsidized by telcos on their 2 year contract., Hence, it is actually a lot more expensive when open line., Buy a tablet., Like an android tablet and get a bigger screen, at a much cheaper price., Use it free without spending for calls, texting and so on., And avoid the telco/mobile phone manufacturer cartel!, Sep 15th, 2010 at 12:03 am, samsung supplies almost all of iphone?s components., que mas sino man ang mas maganda o mas magaling, panalo pa rin samsung., Sep 15th, 2010 at 12:06 am, @Jom Samsung wave beats iphone in everything., well, except maybe the app store., Sep 15th, 2010 at 1:14 am, wave design is not unique just look around it and you?ll notice nexus one lol, i have a wave so dont bother saying ?have u used it?, anyway simplicity ease of use intuitiveness smooth user interface are amongst the iphones best selling feature, and they only make phones every year, unlike other phone makers that does it every day lol, imagine u just bought ur phone a whie ago then after waking up ur already outdated, well the fact to the matter is apple knows what people wants and needs they dont just put all features onto a phone(n97 every1)cos they know it will humper the performance of the device thus making u annoyed and unsatisfied, i dont have iphone 4 but when it comes here in the phils ill sure get one., another thing is the resale value of apple products its unbelievable..(i bought iphone 3g 2nd hand for 25k and sold it at 24k with 4months of usage), Sep 15th, 2010 at 10:22 am, @mike
why pay for electricity too.., or taxes., ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH!, Syempre from the brand itself LOGO palang sa iphone4
price na sa samsung:-), as always nice review, very straightforward
????????????-
the device performs very well without any significant lags when navigating and switching between apps., The system feels very snappy and apps launch pretty quickly., It very noticeable especially when processing large files of photos or videos (and that built-in video editor works like a charm)., ????????????-

Apple iPhone haters = Sucks!, why hate the iPhones?, Android phone lovers = Rocks!, customization and fragmentation
iPhone 4 + Jailbreak = Winners!, Nothing can top these
Samsung Phone lovers = Samsung fans or maybe Koreans., ?Me too? bandwagon..kung ano meron yung sikat tatapatan ng Samsung hehe, @raymond ? Globe, as the exclusive network carrier of iPhone4 has made micro SIM customized for this phone?SMART, however (in anticipation of unlock iPhone 4) has already produced micro SIMs for their broadband plug it?try to check it out..lol
@eric ? tamaaaaaaaaaaa?.but BADA (korean term for ocean) is a platform with limitless opportunities of growth..it will certainly emerge as a giant platform (just like Android) in two or three years time.., as i said to my past comment about this phone:, thumbs down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, iPOD TOUCH 4G pa rin ang the best FTW!!!, parehas lang ng iPhone 4.., hindi pwede pantawag nyehehe!.., pero mas super duper cheaper!, Eh there are already iPhone4s on sale out there? What about prepaid users who have been using their SIM card for years?, There are people who would not change their old numbers., So mano-mano nilang puputulin yung SIM card nila?, First, the risks in destroying your SIM card trying to cut it just to fit this phone., Second, hindi ko na magagamit ang SIM card ko sa ibang cellphone., Here?s the P45k cellphone completely destroyed after only 4 low level drops., http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7-OBoDFeDY
So ito pala yung ?stronger than plastic? ?same material used in helicopter glass? na sinasabi ni Steve Jobs., So in the event that this happens to my iPhone 4, what phone can I now use my micro-SIM for?, In the first place, what?s the point in modifying the size of the SIM card when there?s nothing wrong with that size?, For you folks who hates this, you?re obviously not the intended target market., If you cant afford it, no one is forcing you to buy one, or change your sim size, or change your prepaid lifesyle., No need to rant and complain about something you?re not gonna buy anyway., tama si manny? don?t buy this expensive piece of sh*t!, let the fanbois spend their money and hopefully they wont spread their foolishness.., buti na lang hindi ito nakamamamatay?
iPOD TOUCH 4G FTW!, Sep 16th, 2010 at 12:31 am, ? i?d rather buy an original macbook and an iphone 4 clone or ipod touch, hehe, o diba magkamuka p din sa malayo?, Sep 16th, 2010 at 1:09 am, i owned the iphone 2g, 3g and the 3gs., im no iphone hater., i love beautiful things that are easy to use., and i can afford them., then i found the wave, galaxy s, and im dying to get the new galaxy tab(if desire hd comes first, the galaxy tab will have to wait)., now i realized that power and beauty need not come with a steep price., you just have to look deeper to find the real gem., Sep 16th, 2010 at 8:07 am, if you guys don?t like the iphone, then so be it., there is no need to insult those who happen to like it and call them names., everyone has their own preferences and opinions and it?s just a matter of respecting each other., right????, @manny, I agree with you wholeheartedly., Hindi ba phone review ito and not the official iPhone 4 site?, It?s from the official site that they say that this phone is made from glass that is? 
?Chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic?., ?the same type of glass used in the windshields of helicopters and high-speed trains?., But it was completely shattered after only 4 drops?, Kawawa naman yung mga taong maglalabas ng P45K because they think that they got the hands-down best mobile phone in the world just because its name starts with an ?i?., But this is a ripoff., ok guys..to be clear, im a blackberry fan..although im also happy with my old simple nokia., but i think the real issue here?is the pricing in the phils., For the 16GB, i heard Apple.sg is offering this unlocked at S$888 (approx Php29,000), not exhorbitant as the phil grey market ranging from 41k, 78k, or 90k., for the same 16GB model, the telcos offer only at S$210 (~Php7K), with only S$56 MSF (~Php1.8K) that includes 500texts, 200mins call, 12GB data plan., compare that to Globe?s (based on the 3GS offer) at Php19K for 1800 plan., and this pricing issue i noticed, is the same for laptops, LCD/LED tv?s, and other new electronics in the market., now the question is..if its being offered at the lower prices i quoted, would you reconsider getting this?, iphone?s best selling feature?, Sep 17th, 2010 at 6:20 am, to all fanbois and gals: buti nga at d nakakamatay ang bumili nito kc mbuti ng mamatay kesa sa maging tangang buhay!, Wth!, Eh maraming mas maganda p dto pag dating sa features na below 40k.., Common sense? You just buy the name not the device.., Sep 17th, 2010 at 6:52 am, @manong: i love the ipod touch 4th gen., Sep 17th, 2010 at 9:10 am, Di ko magets bakit ang daming Samsung and HTC and Android fanboys na tumitingin pa sa page na to, when they say they hate the Iphone., If you don?t like it, fine., Nobody?s forcing you to like it, or even buy it., @Bogito, oo tanga lang ang bibili ng iPhone na 92K, e meron namang 45K lang., Piece of advice, itry mo kse muna bago ka mag-judge., Sep 18th, 2010 at 1:45 am, epic fail ata kung bibili ka ng iphone 4 na pwedeng pambili ng APAT na ipod touch 4g? kahit sabihin mo pang lower quality? parehas pa rin ang ginagawa nito!, sige sayo na ang gimik multitasking kuno, sideviewing angle (para kang tanga!) saka mgpicture picture ka sa camerang parehas walang image stabilizer!, Sep 18th, 2010 at 3:54 am, share ko lang po insight ko about iphone?
it is best used with a data plan para maenjoy nyo fully ang internet and social networking capabilities nito? yep pwede naman wifi lang kaso it is made to be mobile kaya mas maganda gumamit ng data plan?
as for the glitches, there are a few
1., reception issues ? pero hardly felt
2., proximity sensor issues ? sobrang sensitive konting layo mo lang ng face mo sa screen while on a call will wake the touchscreen thus making you accidentally press the mute or end call buttons with your cheeks
3., battery life ? extensive usage of ipod, camera, and data will drain your battery very quick., like very very quick
hindi po siya advisable na gamitin on a prepaid basis bec of the reason stated above., if magpreprepaid po kayo eh mas maganda bumili ng isang regular phone and the new ipod touch so you can still experience ios and its apps., magkaiba yung klase ng screen ng iPhone 4 at iPod touch 4., Although parehong RETINA DISPLAY., Ibang-iba., I have not tested either both., nakita ko lang sa isang site., Do I need TO pay for at&t?, How much WIll u sell it and where?, are they selling any at sm clark?, Sep 20th, 2010 at 1:30 am, Globe Telecom have already started pre-ordering of the Iphone4 a couple of weeks back., The process was a lot faster when you have initially registered in their website., These are the prices:
16GB
From Php 37,499
FREE at Plan 3799 
32GB
From Php 43,699
FREE at Plan 5000
I was never a fan of apple phones so I couldnt really comment on it., But the new upgrade seems to be a worldwide thing so I might actually get one., I owned a couple of smartphones in the past and most of them are either Nokia or HP., Nokia smartphones are easier for me to use and the apps at the Ovi store may not be a lot? but there were enough for me and my needs., Recently, I bought a Samsung Galaxy S because I have been going nuts over the Android technology., So far, the performance is exactly what I expected from an Android., It syncs fast, it multi-task, it shares online in a tap of a finger, and its light built makes it easier to carry around., Athough, one downfall include the short battery life? In approx 30mins of extensive use the batt will decrease approx 1/8 after a full charge., So in approx 2hr use the battery might not last until the evening., in short, I dont recommned this as your primary phone unless you ahve a power outlet nearby or if you actually have a car charger with you everytime., For those of you concerned with the fact thats its a little harder to type on a touchscreen? Samsung Galaxy S helps their users with the Swype technology where you wouldnt need to lift a finger to pick the next letter? just swipe your fingers across the screen pad., Another plus is you could pick different types of keypad that you are more comfortable with., You couldd choose the qwerty board? the 3?4 keypad (the ones candy bar phones have).., The apps at the market are great and most are very useful compared to what you find at the Ovi store., Unfortunately, this could also be very overwhelming to some and sometimes people tend to download almost anyting with 4stars rating., This would eventually make any android phone slow and take up so much battery life? the various apps installed could crash too? since not all apps found in the market are always compatible with all versions of the android., e series and communicator.i have used and played with iphone 3g and 3gs and currently own an ipad 64gig..i am currently using android 2.1 samsung galaxy s..guess what?, they are all great..each having their own strengths and weakness.why not use an iphone?, i do not think its the price for me,,if i really like something then i will get it?akin lang naman ayoko ko kasi minsan umasta yung iba na naka iphone na porke naka iphone sila feeling super ganda o yaman o angat sila sa iba..parang ilitista.., @gerjoy,,,ok naman battery ng galaxy s..install ka lang task killer,minsan kasi dami palang bukas na apps na hindi natin alam..at kadalasan improve battery niya after 6 to 8 cycles ng drain at charge.., Nobody here is trolling., For P25,000 you really do get a worthless paperweight., iPhone is plagued with reception problems (death grip) and I find it funny that people still pay a hefty price for something that?s bound to be outdated by the manufacturer in the next 6 months, then have to jailbreak it for it to be usable., Tsk tsk., Sep 21st, 2010 at 4:19 am, ang daming mga tao dito na sinasabi na hindi maganda ang iphone 4 and masyadong expensive., If you cannot afford it just Shut up because there are people who likes it and willing to shell out their hard earned money if i know wala lang kayong pambili kaya you just convince yourself na pangit yung ip4 hahaha just my two cents., Sep 22nd, 2010 at 9:04 am, I had been using an iphone for the longest time then I replaced it with the Galaxy S and talagang maganda ang screen at ang daming features na wala sa iphone kaya lang Apple always manage to create cool looking devices kaya malamang mapabili din ako nito., Sep 22nd, 2010 at 9:09 am, @ steve:
I guess it?s all about the money if you have it feel free to spend it anyway you like., If people want to spend it on a very expensive paperweight let them be di naman galing syo or kahit kanino dito sa atin ang pera nila e., Sep 22nd, 2010 at 10:57 am, to all people with negative comments regarding the iphone 4, na-try niyo na ba gamitin?, because if hindi pa, you?re just making a fool of yourself., para kayong nagtuturo magdrive e hindi naman kayo nakakapagdrive talaga., yes it is expensive pero imho, worth it naman kung yun talaga gusto mo., ok, madaming glitch pero naha-highlight lang since almost all smartphone companies/fanboys are trying to prove that theirs is better that the iphone., lahat naman ng phone may kanya kanyang glitch., i recently bought mine kaya i can attest na madaming gamit yung phone and the glitches do not really cause you much trouble., and the phone is usable kahit hindi jailbroken., if you can spend 30k+ on the phone, why not a couple of hundreds of applications?, Why yes, random poster., I indeed have tried both the iPhone 3G and the 4., The interface is great for novice users, and usability is great., Pages load quick because there is no Adobe Flash., Therefore, some media is not displayed on the iPhone., The app store is the only thing I like about it, as the apps are in their hundred thousands and are properly categorized and easy to use., I dislike the problems the iPhone 4 has., Reception decreases due to it?s aluminum casing., The build quality is not all great., I have seen occurrences of the back plate getting cracked., Overall, I hate apple and their products., Firstly, they remove advanced options in a big to increase usability., They come up with a new model ever 6 months., They want you to pay more to use features which have been on phones for a long time., (iPhone 3G does not have video recording) 
Lastly, all I hear in their ads are ?great?, ?astounding?, ?amazing?, ?Beautiful? and such and pay  no attention to specs., I can safely say that the HTC Desire is much better and much cheaper than the iPhone 3G/4., maski hindi pa ako nagkaroon ng iphone maliban lang sa ipod touch sa palagay ko walang tatalo sa OS nito., and hoping to have one in the future., Oct 2nd, 2010 at 11:01 am, Guys question.., I?m having problems with the battery life of my iPhone4., You may find this exaggerating but I lose 1% in the battery status bar for every 10 minutes., I find this very odd or is this normal in iPhone?, Mind you, I?m a newbie with the brand., I?m a Nokia user before and had no complain with their battery life (had e71 and e72., I searched the net for possible solutions and it turns out that to ?RESTORE? the phone might help it., Well, as I write this, I?m trying to follow that option., However, as I checked, Itunes is saying that downloading the software update needs 11 hrs of completion., Tell me iPhone4 users out there if you are experiencing the same??, I need a techie advice here., I?m loving this phone (software wise and other apps) but its battery life seems a mediocre contrary to reviews that it has a superb battery life., Oct 2nd, 2010 at 11:20 am, Oct 2nd, 2010 at 11:22 am, You merely bought an iPhone to show off., Oct 2nd, 2010 at 11:23 am, Note: I tried to totally drain the batt, then turned off the phone while recharging it for 4 hours in my first attempt., Did the same thing on my second charging for 3 hrs that time but still the problem didn?t resolve., Oct 2nd, 2010 at 11:25 am, The iPhone 4 doesn?t allow you to change it?s battery by yourself., Your fault for buying such a nonsense phone., Oct 2nd, 2010 at 11:47 am, Steve, i don?t need your nonsense opinion., Get a life!, P.S: I never mentioned that I can change the battery by myself., I was just looking for possible solutions to improve its battery life., And oh?
You?re a retard., Oct 2nd, 2010 at 11:49 am, ?You?re a retard?
Says the person who buys an overrated, expensive phone then complains about it!, We can go on about this the whole day, homofag., @milnor_a: or pwede rin na mahina ang signal ng globe jan sa area nyo kaya extra effort yung phone na makakuha ng signal., ganyang din ang nangyayari sa ibang phone, Thanks for the feedback anyways., I appreciated it sir., I never experienced a bad battery when I had E71 then later on E72., I purchased this phone when per reviews, this has a superb battery life., Oct 3rd, 2010 at 10:22 am, @milnor_a: yung friend ko sa Singapore yung nagsabi sa akin na mabilis malobat yung iphone 4., Check mo na lang task manager baka may mga running apps sa background., Pero kalimitan din sa mga battery ay kailangan ng 3 to 4 times na cycle bago mo maramdaman yung performance? yung cycle na sinasbi ko ay from full charge to empty?., then charge again pero dapat off yung phone then gamitin mo ulit hanggang sa madrain ung battery then charge ulit? iwasan mo rin maovercharge ung battery, So I guess my next question is what is the standard length in charging the iPhone4 after its initial charging??, Out of the box, the phone was at 65%., I started my initial charging when it turned to 10%., I left the phone on while charging for 2 hours until it reached 100%., This time, it was turned off and let it charged for about 4 hrs., Same means was done on my last charging (3 hrs though)., But all of these ways didn?t improve the battery life of my phone at all., Mind you, I only use this for Texting so far., What more if I started to use other applications?!, I just can?t imagine how battery will drain fast by then., @milnor_a: for iphone 4, the average charging time is 3 to 4 hrs (depends on your charging method.., via usb or via ac) your iphone 4 and my galaxy s battery is almost the same., Galaxy S is Li-Po 1500 mAh and Iphome 4 is Li-Po 1420mAh., Your phone should last for at-least 2 days since you are using it for texting only., Try to view some forums about iphone 4 maybe some iphone 4 users out there has the same problem., I will try to ask my friend about the performance of his iphone 4, hopefully I can get some tips and tricks to solve your problem., Oct 4th, 2010 at 2:23 am, @milnor malamang may defect ung WIFI mo yan din ang problem ko sa 3gs ko dati., mabilis ma lowbat., within 3-4 hrs lang low bat na., i turn off mo lagi ung wifi mo pag d mu ginagamit kasi yan ang pinaka malakas gumamit ng battery.pag ganun pa din isauli mu na yan sa pinag bilihan mo, Be my savior sir and let me know your findings., And yeah, 1 day or less battery life using texting alone is completely unacceptable!, By the way, I just visited Globe center in Megamall., They said that the only thing they can do is to Restore my phone which I can basically also do at home., I have some bad connections lately so restoring my phone so far is not successful., They also noted that should restoring failed to resolve my issue, the most that they can do is to send my unit to Singapore for replacement since there?s no repair center for iPhones here in the country., The brand new unit will be shipped in the span of 2-3 weeks., @Knives, thanks for the input., I actually turned off my wi-fi when I found out that it?s one of the factors why my battery drains fast., I checked various forums regarding this., I also turned off notifications and 3G as well but still my phone can only last a day even if I only use it for texting., @milnor_a: sabi ng friend ko umaabot ng 2 days ung battery nya more on gps at apps ang paggamit nya bihira din sya magphone call., i recommend instead of buying you should pick n8 or n97 cause it?s a great phone than iphone 4 compare at this website   http://phonegg.com/compare/26/Nokia-N8-vs-Apple-iPhone-4-16GB.html, ACTUALY, DA IPHONE 4 AND NOKIA SACK SHEEET!, IF U SEEN DA BOTH, THEY R SHITTZY!, I GETTING SAMSUNG GALAXY S AND HTC DESIRE., San pwede magpa unlock ng iphone 4?, Oct 9th, 2010 at 9:35 am, i got my iphone4 32gb here in UK?., So far everything is fine?

Do you put a premium on the mouse?, Discuss this product, What's hot: Beautiful design, sharp display, Facetime., What's not: Not a phone you want to drop, reception and call quality iffy., Reviewed June 25, 2010 by Lisa Gade, Editor, Though it might sound like I'm talking about a Manhattan skyscraper, I'm really describing Apple's latest iPhone., The iPhone 4 departs from the rounded corners and (literally) feel good design of the past 3 iPhone models and goes for modern, angular  sharp edges., It's a thing of beauty to look at, though I'm not sure I prefer it over the iPhone 3GS., Maybe that's a gender thing; women are supposed to prefer soft lines, but being a tech geek I'm not typical-- I actually loved the Motorola Droid's incredibly angular design., But that's up to you, prospective buyer., See the cat in the background?, iOS 4 lets you use a camera image as a background., On a more objective front, a naked iPhone 4 is much less comfortable to hold than the 3G and 3GS., The stainless edges dig into the hand, and as Steve Jobs has already told us, we're supposed to hold it like a dainty watercress sandwich when talking on the phone., If you hold the phone in a typical manner with your left hand (as most right-handed people do), your hand will cover and bridge the antenna reducing bars and call quality (we've witnessed this on two review phones)., Steve says to be particularly avoidant of the lower left corner., Only Apple, a company with a marketing machine that could sell oxygen to anaerobic bacteria, manages to get away with these design failings and dictums., Take the MacBook Pro and it's toasty underbelly: Apple says (really) that it's not a laptop, it's a notebook., Therefore you shouldn't expect to use it on your lap., The iPhone 4 (right) is thinner than the iPhone 3GS., This means you'll want to use your iPhone 4 with a case: your hand won't touch the antenna directly, you won't have to worry that the glass front and backs might shatter (at least not so easily) if you drop the phone, and a case will improve comfort., Given the near ubiquitous nature of iPhone 3 and 3GS cases (I see maybe 1 in  100 sans case), this likely won't be a problem., And it will keep the incredibly healthy i-accessory industry alive in a recession., The glass panels are made of Gorilla Glass, a product that is supposed to resist scratches like all heck., Glass in general is hard to scratch since it's one of the harder materials on earth; but just in case your wife gets mad at you and drags her diamond wedding ring across your iPhone, it might survive without looking like scarface., The glass surfaces certainly look gorgeous and it's a pleasant change from the super-scratch prone back on the iPhone 3 and 3GS., But you'll never see it since it will be wearing a case, remember?, The iPhone 3GS was supposed to be the iPhone on speed, but the iPhone 4 runs circles around it., It has double the RAM (512 megs) and it uses Apple's new custom A4 CPU that's also found on the iPhone's pal the iPad., I would never have described the iPhone 3GS as slow, even when running iOS 4, but it seems like the iPhone 4's slightly slow cousin when you use them side by side., Fast is good these days where we take life in 3 second tweets and fast forward our way through TV shows courtesy of the DVR., It's especially good if you like gaming, and the iPhone still reigns as the best mobile gaming platform, bar none., Even the most demanding games run fluently on the iPhone 4, and when enhanced for the new Retina Display, they look better too., The Retina Display, which packs 4 times more pixels into a 3.5" touch screen than the previous gen iPhone's, is indeed sharp., Whether you have young and keen eyes or old and presbiopic eyes, you'll see the difference if an old gen and iPhone 4 are placed side by side., Amazon has already updated their Kindle application to take advantage of the Retina Display and fonts are smooth enough for an amoeba to slide down the slope of the letter s., the old 320 x 480, you won't see more stuff on screen., This is something akin to pixel-doubling where icons, text and other UI elements are scaled up, because it would be incredibly difficult to read on a screen that small running at such a high resolution, even with 326 ppi (pixels per inch) of clarity., Example: the Sony Vaio P 8" notebook running at 1600 x 768 resolution (with something around 210 ppi density) is incredibly sharp but hard on the eyes nonetheless., How about call quality?, Do any of you still make calls, or are threaded messaging and social networking (with background multi-tasking apps in the works for iOS 4) enough for you?, Some reviewers have stated that call quality is much better than previous generation iPhones, despite the often lower signal bars and troublesome antenna design., Sorry to say, but our iPhone's call quality is no better than the 3GS., Despite the new tower tuning method that looks for the tower with the least congestion (even if it means fewer bars), our iPhone 4 garbles outgoing words a bit when the signal is at 33% or lower according to signal bars (Apple has removed the old code that showed you signal in the industry standard -db)., Incoming audio is on the other hand much improved and volume is good., The iPhone 4 is a relative rarity: it's not just quad band GSM (that's common), it's quad band 3G HSDPA., That means 3G will work in the US on AT&T, in Canada, Europe and Asia where GSM networks with 3G are available., It will not work on T-Mobile's US 3G network however., Our iPhone game and accessory reviewer Thomas Slayton reports on Facetime:, As I lounged on the couch, I surprised my wife in the next room with her first ?Facetime? call., For those of you who are unfamiliar with Facetime, it?s video chat over WiFi made easy., You can send video from your choice of front or rear camera., The iPhone 4 wasn?t the first to offer this feature, but Apple certainly has taken what was arguably a toy for techies and brought it to the mainstream., I say this because I could never see my mother drilling down into a video chat app to tweak settings and build a friends list., However, I sure as heck could see her pressing the large, friendly Facetime button., In short; this works as advertised., As long as you have a WiFi connection, you can engage in a video chat with other iPhone 4 owners., I certainly wouldn?t use it to call my boss but for friends and family, it?s solid gold., Marketing tells us that lots of megapixels is a good thing., Our eyes tell us that it isn't so., We've seen some 5 and 8 megapixel smartphone cameras that just plain depress us., And Apple is the undisputed king of marketing, so when Steve Jobs told us the iPhone 4's camera was the bee's knees, we took it with a grain of silicon., Happily, Steve was telling the truth, and the iPhone 4 not only beats the mediocre iPhone 3GS for still image quality, it's among the best 5 megapixel shooters., In fact, it takes better photos than the HTC EVO 4G and its 8 megapixel shooter., Here are two sample photos, with a 100% crop of each:, Video quality on the 3GS was pretty good, at least relative to its photo quality., The iPhone 4 takes 720p video at a natural 30fps that's good enough to leave an older generation Flip Video at home., It's not as good as Nokia Nseries smartphones, at least not those made in the past 2 years, but it's better than most camera phones on the market., We did note a tendency to overexpose, which you'll see in our sample video., That video was shot indoors on a cloudy day-- we'd understand if we were outside in bright sunlight but that wasn't the case here., Given the light loving sensor, videos shot in less bright locations actually look better., Recorded volume was too low in our tests., The nearly featureless camera application gains a few features: zoom and selectable focus points., Tap on the viewfinder to select the focus point and bring up the digital zoom bar., Unlike most camera phones, you can shoot in portrait mode as well as landscape., Video file sizes are surprisingly small, our sample video is 40 seconds and 53 megs., After the camera has saved the video, you can email it, send it via MMS or upload it to YouTube., The recorded video format is 1280 x 720 resolution, MPEG 4 MOV /H.264 format with AAC mono audio., Since iOS 4 has user selectable wallpapers, you can use camera images as wallpaper., Continuing reception issues aside, the iPhone 4 is the best iPhone yet, and it's still one of the best smartphones on the market., After 4 years, the competition is catching up though, and we've seen this before with Apple., I started life as an engineer working on Apple peripherals back when Steve Jobs had yet to leave Apple, and over the course of years I've seen truly innovative products come out of Apple that were by far better than anything else on the market., But other manufacturers manage over time to copy and improve their own products, and Apple's lead diminishes., Apple is great at new products that set the tech world on its ear, but they're not so great at revising those products to maintain that clear lead., Not that the iPhone 4 isn't beautiful, incredibly fun and so easy to use that a non-techie grandma could come up to speed in 20 minutes., It is all those things, and Facetime is particularly ingenious because it's so easy to use and it doesn't require any additional plan features or charges., But right now, it's marketing and the incredible App Store that keep the iPhone at the front of the pack., There are other smartphones that have better and more rugged hardware (faster CPUs, larger displays, expandable storage, higher resolution cameras) and a more open app market., They've copied the multi-touch capacitive display, focused on ease of use, true robust multi-tasking and started their own (still smaller) app markets, particularly Android., The Motorola Droid X, HTC EVO 4G on Sprint and the HTC Incredible are strong contenders., Even the aging Palm Pre Plus, thanks to its extreme pocketability, hardware keyboard and innovative, super-friendly OS with more elegant multi-tasking has something to offer against the iPhone., If you're an iPhone person, by all means get the iPhone 4., If you're an AT&T customer who enjoys AT&T service, then get the iPhone 4., But if you're not happy with AT&T, remember that their iPhone exclusive ends next year (2011), and you'll probably be able to get the next iPhone on another US carrier., And AT&T's ETF for the iPhone 4 is $325, so you won't be able to leave AT&T until June 2012 at the soonest (assuming you got the phone the week it launched) without coughing up some dough., These prices are with a 2 year contract, and note that AT&T has a higher ETF (early termination fee) of $325 if you end your contract early., Display: Retina Display: 3.5" capacitive IPS multi-touch display running at 960 x 640 resolution, 326ppi, 800 to 1 contrast ratio., Screen size diagonally: 3.5".Supports both portrait and landscape modes via accelerometer., Has ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, compass and gyroscope., Battery is not user replaceable., Phone: GSM quad band  world phone 850/900/1800/1900MHz., Can shoot video at 720p, 30fps., Has front-facing VGA camera that can be used with Facetime video calls over WiFi., Comment: I Have too Hand It Too The iPhone, A Massive Achievement From Apple, I Have Had One Of, If Not The Best  Experience Of Smart Phones From This Device, Than Any Other, You Can Tout The iPhone Is "Expensive" And "Doesnt Work Properly", But It Does, And Yeah On paper, The Desire May Have A Better camera Ooohhh.., Or A Better battery Life Oooohh., But Using Them Both On A Daily basis, I Couldn't Stand The Slow, Buggy Android Platform, Its Not Worth The Time Or Effort, Whereas The iPhone, Just Works, Like It Says It Will., I Would rate It Ten Star If I Could, Fantastic, I own it, Bad: battery life, mini-SIM, no standard USB, paying for things others get for free, Apple dictating what apps you cannot have, Comment: No go for me because:
- If you use it to play games the battery runs out in 10 hours
- It only takes mini-SIM, which means that I cannot use another phone if I need to
- If you forget your charger behind you cannot use another standard charger (micro usb)
- Apple dictating what apps you can and cannot have (example, no Amazon music shop, which is much cheaper than Apple and DRM free), Comment: To Kirstie Priest-Billingham,
I would go for a galaxy S., The iPhone is good but there is the problem with the antenna and it is not worth spending so much money on a smartphone that loses signal when you hold it a certain way., The galaxy S display is stunning and the camera is great too., Apple iPhone 4 review, To view this content, JavaScript must be enabled and you need the latest version of the Adobe Flash Player, Get the latest Flash player, See all 92 user reviews, What do you think?, I own it 557, I want it 452, The iPhone 4 is expensive, but Apple's handset is faster, fresher and more fun than ever., Apple has perked up the camera, jazzed up the screen and smartened up the software to improve an already great phone, although the competition is catching up, Apple iPhone 4 monthly deals From ?25.00, Apple iPhone 4 Pay As You Go deals From ?570.00, Apple iPhone 4 SIM free deals From ?599.00

		Best Mobile Phones
		Popular Mobile Phones, Best cheap Android phones, Wonderfully easy to use, Simple multitasking functionality, Video calling that only works between iPhone 4 handsets over Wi-Fi, Signal drops when you hold the phone in a certain way, Doesn't feel as thin as it is, Tied to iTunes software, At the start of summer, geeks stock up on sunscreen and mentally prepare for the annual reboot of a phone they either love, or love to hate -- Apple's iPhone., Wisely, Apple hasn't sought to reinvent the wheel with the iPhone 4, but its sleek
new look,?handful of exciting new hardware features, and?refreshed software has still managed to make us fall in love once more., But the iPhone 4 will leave a substantial dent in your wallet., If
you buy it directly from Apple, SIM-free and unlocked for use on any network, the
iPhone 4 will cost ?499 for the 16GB version and ?599 for the 32GB version., It's also
available from free on a ?45-a-month contract., You can find the best deal for you by checking our price-comparison article., Glass and steel
The previous iPhone reboot, the iPhone 3GS,
kept the same appearance as its predecessor, the iPhone 3G., This time, it's a whole new ball game, with the curved back of previous iPhones
replaced by a flat, glass rear., Apple's case protects the phone and should help with reception problems caused by obscuring the antenna, Apple says that glass is more resistant to scratches than
plastic, but we've smashed enough screens to think that this change could be a
boon to case manufacturers., For the first time, Apple is even flogging a case
when you buy the phone from the online
Apple store -- it's a 'bumper' that surrounds the edges of the phones with rubber., Despite its flat front and back, and a case that's only
9mm thick, the iPhone 4 feels surprisingly solid and sturdy., But it doesn't feel as thin as it really is -- considering that
it's the thinnest smart phone out there, it feels much like the 3GS,
which is about 3mm thicker at its widest point, but rounded so it's thinner at the very edges., That's not to
say that the iPhone 4 feels chunky -- it just doesn't feel as wafer-thin as we
expected., Appearance is always a matter of taste., Some may adore the
iPhone 4's more industrial appearance, but others will prefer the rounded curves
of the older models., We fall into the latter camp., Maybe that's just because we miss spinning the 3GS on its back when we're bored., Call me quick 
The glass back should also help the iPhone 4 to hold its network connection,
since it should be transparent to radio signals., Although we adored almost everything about the
previous iPhone, it was terrible for
making boring old phone calls., The overloaded O2 network, which suffered
from congestion when O2 was the only carrier to have the iPhone, was partly to
blame for that., The glass front and back are trimmed with a steel band around
the edge, split into two pieces -- hence the seams that Gizmodo
revealed when it leaked an iPhone 4 prototype., The seams have a purpose: the
two pieces of steel act as antennas -- one for Wi-Fi, GPS and Bluetooth, and
the other for the mobile-phone network., It sounds like a genius idea, but it didn't take ZDNet UK
editor Rupert Goodwins long to figure out a
flaw -- when you grab an antenna with your hands, it adversely affects reception., We tested the iPhone 4 with a Vodafone SIM card and, although we usually have five full bars of delicious Vodafone coverage in our elite testing tree house, the signal dropped to one
lonely bar after a minute or so?when we held the phone normally in our left hand., That means answering your phone in a one-bar
environment could reduce the signal to zero bars, although we didn't experience that problem, thanks to Vodafone's solid coverage in our area., Obscuring the seam on the iPhone 4's left side can lead to a reduction in signal strength


The drop in signal strength only seemed to occur when we held the phone in our left hand, with the bottom of our palm slightly covering the bottom-left corner of the phone., Holding the phone in our right hand, or along the top, didn't seem to affect reception., We lost one bar just by pressing a fingertip against the seam that's on the bottom-left corner, so perhaps this is where the trouble lies., We'll be getting our crack team of antenna engineers to investigate the issue more thoroughly soon., We did experience one call that failed to connect and went
straight to voicemail, so it seems that the iPhone's call issues haven't been
totally resolved., We'll be keeping our eyes on this issue during our long-term test of
the phone, during which we'll use other networks, so stay tuned., The iPhone 4 includes an extra microphone for noise-cancelling purposes., We compared the phone to a Google
Nexus One, which also has noise-cancelling microphone, by making a call next to a TV
playing vuvuzela-blaring World Cup coverage., We called the same landline phone
from both mobiles, and both calls were clear and audible, although the Nexus
One did a marginally better job of cutting out background noise., We
also found that the output of the iPhone 4's speaker was easier to hear than that of previous iPhones, and we didn't have to place it as accurately against our lugholes., Look into my retinas 
Besides its glass makeover, the iPhone 4's dolled itself up with a
spectacular-looking new display., Apple's calling it a 'retina display', and it
has a 960x640-pixel resolution, which is quadruple the number of pixels sported
by the iPhone 3GS in the same 89mm (3.5-inch) area., The 3GS' 480x320-pixel screen is lovely and very usable,
but the iPhone 4's display is noticeably better., Even compared to the stunningly clear, 480x854-pixel
screen of the Motorola
Milestone, the iPhone 4's display has the advantage because of its bright whites and
midnight-dark blacks., The screen makes everything look crisper, and, since
user-interface elements like buttons are vector graphics, many parts of apps
will look better without developers having to rebuild them to take advantage of
the increased resolution., But, ironically, the extra resolution reveals the fuzziness of icons and
images that haven't been scaled up to handle it., It's definitely a case of the more pixels the merrier as far as ebooks
and Web pages are concerned., The text on Web pages looks as sharp as
a razor -- no matter how closely you zoom in -- and ebooks also look wonderful., Apple's iBooks app has made it to the iPhone 4., The super-sharp screen means ebooks look great, That's good news given the revelation that Apple's ebook
app, iBooks, is coming to the iPhone from the iPad., If you're a proud iPad
owner, the ebooks that you buy on there will be available to download again for
free on the iPhone 4., But you may be annoyed by one quirk of iBooks on the iPhone
4 -- the buttons to open the store and edit your library are reversed compared
to the iPad's, for no good reason we can see., Fourth time's the
charm 
The iPhone 4 runs the latest version of the iPhone
operating system, iOS 4., We're fervent fans of the iPhone's intuitive user
interface, and iOS 4 adds some features we've been craving, including a light
dusting of multitasking., That means you can theoretically listen to Spotify
while you surf, or make a Skype
call at any time --?once the companies have updated their apps to take advantage of the feature --??because the app is always running in the background., The multitasking feature already offers advantages, even without updated apps., For example, Web pages will
load in the background while you go off and do something else, and you can stop writing an email to look something up in your notes, without losing
what you've written., It's basic stuff compared to what's offered by a desktop
computer, since only a few, restricted program types can run in the background, such as VoIP and music apps., But this feature is easy to use and doesn't drain the iPhone's
battery as much as true multitasking would., FaceTime lets you make video calls to other iPhone 4 owners -- but only over Wi-Fi


The iPhone's email app has also received some polish., You can now read new emails from all your accounts in one combined inbox, and group conversations as in Gmail., The Palm Pre Plus
and BlackBerry
range of phones also handle email very well, but these improvements put the
iPhone 4 up there with the best touchscreen smart phones in this field., Finally, Apple has given us some power
over our home screens?with iOS 4., Previously, the only thing you could do to make your
phone your own was to slap an image on the lock screen and order your apps., Now
you have the option to add wallpaper to the home screens and sort your icons
into folders., It's not much, but it's a welcome change, especially since there
are apps that you may not have any interest in, such as Stocks (especially once you've blown your nest egg on the latest iPhone),?but are unable to delete., You can also get iOS 4 on the 3GS, so it's not unique
to the iPhone 4., For more information on what's new, check out our full iOS 4
story, and also see our detailed comparison of iOS 4 and the latest iteration of Google's Android operating system, version 2.2., LED light, camera,
action 
Apple has bumped up the resolution of the iPhone's camera to 5 megapixels,
and added an LED photo light to help out in dark situations., With a steady
hand, it's easy to get decent shots with the iPhone 4 and, thanks to the LED light,
shots in dim conditions are surprisingly good., The on-screen controls for the LED
light are easy to use., We also love the touch-to-focus feature, which does just
what it says on the tin, providing a quick, intuitive way to let the phone's
automatic focus and brightness controls know what you really want to capture., Naturally, the phone's snapper can't compete with a compact
camera in terms of photo quality or exposure controls, but we'd be happy to have the
iPhone 4 in our pocket for those Facebook photo emergencies., The biggest bonus of the iPhone 4's camera is its super-fast
shutter speed., It takes only a split second to capture a shot after you've pressed the on-screen shutter
button., That's a big bonus in those?situations when
you really need to take a photo., The iPhone 4 also records 720p, high-definition video at 30
frames per second, and video has the same tap-to-focus feature that previous
iPhones only offered when taking still photos., In our tests, the video quality was
fine, but film suffered from extreme shutter roll, with the world seeming to wobble
like jelly because the camera's processor can't handle motion well enough.?Don't expect the quality of a dedicated camcorder, and you won't be disappointed by mobile-phone video that's
good enough for capturing occasional shenanigans., iTunes makes it easy to sync your photos, along with music
and apps, as long as you don't mind being locked to one computer and one
program., Other phones offer much more flexibility., For example, you can't
store just any file on your iPhone, as you can with many other phones that
work as external flash drives., But, if you just want to keep it simple,
iTunes will do the job, and it also gives you desktop access to Apple's huge
music, video and app emporium., Face up to your calls

The iPhone 4 also treats us to a camera on the front., This camera does take stills but it's mostly meant for video calling -- a feature that Apple has dubbed
FaceTime., FaceTime seems to have impressed the Americans more than the concept of?bacon weave, but?we're not so easily wowed, since we've been basking in video calls in the UK for years., Once more, Apple offers an easy-to-use interface that makes
video calls easy to make and control., FaceTime has plenty of pleasing features, including the fact that the image of your friend's mug rotates automatically when your chum rotates their handset., But FaceTime only works between iPhone 4 handsets and only over Wi-Fi., We don't expect that FaceTime will usher in a
new dawn for a feature that's failed to take off in the past., Chat marathon 
The major drawback of the iPhone has always been its paltry battery life,
but, despite its thin case, the iPhone 4 promises to make improvements., Apple
says we'll get 7 hours of talk time over 3G, and 300 hours of standby time from
the new, bigger battery.?We'll soon be
putting these claims to the test, with a full battery showdown, so stay tuned
for our results., The iPhone 4 also ramps up the Wi-Fi speed, with support for
the latest 802.11n standard., HSPA connectivity enables fast downloads and
uploads over 3G., The prize for the most unpredictable new feature goes to the
iPhone 4's gyroscope, which helps out the phone's accelerometer when it comes
to games and apps that need to know the exact orientation of the phone., We're
looking forward to seeing what developers of augmented-reality apps come up
with to exploit this quirky new toy, but, for now, it doesn't add much to the
experience of using the phone., Happily, Apple hasn't skimped on speed to support all of these
new tricks, and the iPhone 4 is as nippy as a trip down a water slide covered in
K-Y Jelly., Everything from apps to text messages pops up quickly, and the on-screen
keyboard is thrillingly responsive., It also adds a spell-checking feature to make one of
the best
virtual keyboards in the business even better., Conclusion
Apple had plenty to live up to after making three of the highest-rated
phones on CNET UK, and, with fantastic Android-powered handsets such as the HTC Desire
on the market, the competition is stiffer than ever., But we think Apple has
done enough to stay ahead of its rivals, thanks to the iPhone 4's improved camera, the useful software
tweaks in iOS 4, and a simply stunning screen., With a price that's often double
that of competing handsets, the iPhone 4 is very expensive, but no other phone can offer quite the same sheer, silky pleasure., The iPhone 3GS is dead -- long live the iPhone 4.Edited by Charles Kloet?, JD Wetherspoon Pub Finder iPhone app shows you the way to your next cheap pint in Crave, Add your review, See all 92 user reviews, Tell us what you think, Google Nexus One review, 4.0 out of 5, BlackBerry Bold 9780 review, 4.0 out of 5, Nokia 9300 Smartphone review, 4.0 out of 5, 4.0 out of 5, BlackBerry Torch 9800  review, HTC 7 Mozart review, Last chance to vote for Xbox 360 or iPhone in Greatest Gadget tournament, Angry Birds tops iPhone and iPad apps of 2010 in iTunes Rewind charts, Twitter Stay up to date

		Walt Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal, ?New  iPhone Keeps Apple Top of Class?
		But, in my tests, network reception was a mixed bag., Compared with the previous model, the new iPhone dropped marginally  fewer calls made in my car, both in Washington and in Boston, and was  much louder and clearer over my car?s built-in Bluetooth speaker-phone  system.Yet, in some places where the signal was relatively weak, the iPhone 4  showed no bars, or fewer bars than its predecessor., Apple says that  this is a bug it plans to fix, and that it has to do with the way the  bars are presented, not the actual ability to make a call., And, in fact,  in nearly all of these cases, the iPhone 4 was able to place calls  despite the lack of bars.However, on at least six occasions during my tests, the new iPhone  was either reporting ?no service? or searching for a network while the  old one, held in my other hand, was showing at least a couple of bars., Neither Apple nor AT&T could explain this., The iPhone 4 quickly  recovered in these situations, showing service after a few seconds, but  it was still troubling., David Pogue, The New York Times, ?New  iPhone Arrives; Rivals, Beware?
		Sound is much better on both ends of the call, thanks in  part to a noise-canceling microphone and an improved audio chamber  (which also helps speakerphone and music sound)., The stainless-steel  edge band is now part of the antenna., The new phone is also better at  choosing the best channel for connecting with the cell tower, even if?s  not technically the strongest one., (Ever had four bars, but a miserable  connection?, Then you get it.)Does any of this mean no more dropped calls in New York and San  Francisco?, But there do seem to be fewer of them., Ed Baig, USA Today, ?Apple  Makes All the Right Calls on iPhone 4?
		I was impressed with the quality and ease of FaceTime  calling, though the experience seems to depend on a strong Wi-Fi  connection., I encountered momentary hiccups talking with a caller in  Europe and on calls in which I was on the edge of decent Wi-Fi., Josh Topolsky, Engadget, ?iPhone 4  Review?
		Well in our testing, we had far, far fewer dropped calls  than we experienced on our 3GS?It wasn?t perfect, and we had some  connection issues in downtown New York City in particular, though it?s  tough to say if it was the fault of our phone, the cluster of buildings  we were near, or the person we were speaking to, who was on a 3GS in the  same location.The first time we took a call on the device we were walking down New  York?s extremely noisy Fifth Avenue, and right away it was obvious that  the secondary, noise-canceling mic was doing some heavy lifting, at  least on the other end of the line?As far as the  speakerphone goes, it gets loud without distorting or producing cutting  midrange, a problem we?ve noticed on quite a few recent phones., We were a little surprised by the fact that you can only  mute the audio on your [FaceTime] calls; if you want the video off, you  need to cover the lens in the old fashioned way ? with your hands., The battery life on the iPhone 4 has been outstanding  thus far, exceeding our expectations for longevity during testing., We?ve  only had a short time to use the phone, but in the week or so we?ve  been carrying the device as our main phone, we?ve had pretty amazing  results under normal to heavy use., In fact, we managed to squeeze more  than 38 hours ? yes, 38 hours ? of life out of a single charge using the  phone as we normally would., Xeni Jardin, Boing Boing, ?Apple  iPhone 4: Hands-on Review?
		With light use, but with 3G data and WiFi turned on the  whole time, I got a full 4 days of battery life., With very heavy video  recording and playback, instant messaging, email and data tethering over  3G, I got a full day of battery life., I didn?t have enough time before  this review to do careful benchmark testing against Apple?s claims, so I  can?t provide specific percentages, but it felt like the battery life  was a good 20-25% meatier., Standing in one familiar trouble spot that used to drive  me crazy, I often had one or two ?signal strength? bars on the first-gen  iPhone, maybe one or two more bars on the 3GS, and 4 or 5 bars on  iPhone 4.Bottom line: I think the engineering is better., But issues of call  quality and dropped calls will not be completely gone with this improved  device., As we?re now four hardware iterations in, I believe that has  everything, or nearly everything, to do with the carrier., And on the iPhone 4 hardware itself, speed and  sensitivity with [the camera] on the iPhone 4 itself become nothing  short of stunning., I experienced far fewer ?lost moments,? those dead  shots that happen when you?ve tried to grab just the right instant, and  instead you end up with a photo of several instants after the right  instant., I brought my iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 to the Venice Beach skate  park, to take shots of fast-moving skaters in those magical aerial  moments, just before a swan-dive into the belly of the bowl., With  earlier iPhones, man, just forget it?But with iPhone 4, I was able to  tap-tap-tap in rapid succession, or tap once at just the right instant,  and bring home some real trophy jpegs., [Tethering] worked flawlessly over Bluetooth, using  AT&T?s 3G, when the cable modem and wireless network in my office  happened to be down for a while., What more do you want?, It worked when I  wanted it to work., I don?t expect to take possession of an iPhone 4 until Thursday  morning, when I?ll pick one up at my local Apple Store (and blog about  the experience)., If you ordered one for delivery, you  may beat me to the punch., Let?s exchange our own notes once we?ve  spent some time with the beast., For more smart takes on technology, visit Technologizer.com., Story copyright ?

it is., Its video chatting FaceTime is fascinating and fun, the Retina high-resolution screen is a salve to squinters, its 5-megapixel camera is exceptional., But the iPhone 4 also suffers from a couple of niggling issues which, now that you have plenty of superphone choices, make it less than it could have been.Design and LayoutApple touts the iPhone 4 as being the thinnest smartphone ever., The iPhone 4 is actually thicker around the edges than the tapered 3G S, so it feels thicker., And its glass rear is slipperier than the plastic 3G S.The iPhone 4 is a smidgen smaller all around than the 3G S and the same weight, but thanks to the metal band around the perimeter and the glass front and back, it feels more solid., It?s also squarer than the tapered 3G S, which means form-fitting skins won?t fit (they?ll be too small), and the upper frame by the earpiece has a sharper edge, which means a naked iPhone 4 held tight to your ear will feel sharp and uncomfortable.The iPhone 4?s controls and jacks remain in the same place, but the volume controls and home key require a firmer touch, which eliminates accidental presses.StorageInside the iPhone ?General/About/Capacity? settings menu, we?re told the 32 GB S has 29.3 GB of user memory, and the iPhone 4 29.1 GB., When you plug the two phones into iTunes, you?re told the S has actually has 29.33 GB and the iPhone 4 just 29.06 GB., But that approximately 270 MB difference (if my math is right) is not big enough to account for the disparity between the content that fit on my S and what didn?t fit on my 4., I had 4,750 music tracks and 2,250 photos on my 3G S with 1.4 GB left to spare; I had to trim these down to 4,550 tracks and just 400 photos, with just 830 MB left over on the 4 (all other content ? video, apps, books, et al ? remaining consistent between the two)., Considering I was hoping the iPhone 4 would be available in a 64 GB version, this memory short-sheeting is doubly disappointing.Retina DisplayEveryone will be talking about FaceTime, but the iPhone 4?s Retina screen that will be the longest-pleasing improvement.The iPhone 4?s Retina 960 x 640 pixel screen leans to the greener end of the color spectrum compared to the 3G S?s cooler blue hue, most noticeable on white background Web pages, on faces, and on clear blue skies., But those extra pixels make a world of difference in illuminating tiny details and creating sharper edges in images and video., More importantly, the iPhone 4?s screen has deeper blacks (noticeable when comparing the iPhone 4 and the S when in sleep); colors pop in both tone and in contrast like never before.But all of a sudden, the iPhone?s 3.5-inch screen seems small in the expanding world of 4-inch and larger superphone screens.iTunes IntegrationAs it does for photos, the latest version of iTunes gives you the choice of down converting all higher bit-rated AAC and MP3 files to 128 Kbps AAC for use on your iPhone., We were able to save nearly 4GB of space by doing this, with no real loss of headphone sound quality.Sound QualityWe could discern no qualitative improvement from the 3G S, but the speaker did pump out a bit more volume during FaceTime conversations., In a quiet room, we didn?t even have to go much beyond three quarters of maximum volume.12Next ?Related PostsJailbreak iOS 4.1: Hackers quickly find?iPhone 4 vs., Android?s Best: Spec Face-O?White iPhone 4 finally available for spr?RadioShack offers deal for $25 iPhone 4   Tags: Apple ?

?
Following all the hype and hysteria we have come to expect with the launch of Apple products, the iPhone 4 has landed in the UK, for the first time being launched simultaneously with the US., ?
The rollout of Apple handsets didn?t go quite as smoothly as the Cupertino company might have hoped however, with a troubling signal loss issue for anyone holding the iPhone 4 ?incorrectly? ? who knew prior to June 24 that there was a ?correct? way to hold mobiles?, ?

?
Our findings so far are that when you hold the iPhone 4 with your hand covering the bottom left corner, there is a loss of signal., However, we have not found that this has caused us to drop calls or lose data connections when out and about actually using the handset., Whether this is because we?re subconsciously moving our hands to avoid the issue developing is hard to say., ?
That aside, there is no denying that the iPhone 4 is a stunning piece of tech., It?s 24 per cent slimmer than the 3GS at just 9.3mm thick, beautifully compact and elegantly designed with a stainless steel band separating the handset?s scratch-resistant glass covered front and back., ?
It?s this steel band, which is also the aerial, which seems to be causing the problems., Presumably it?s something to do with contact between the metal band and human skin causing conductivity issues as putting a casing on the iPhone seems to alleviate the problem., ?
Bizarre reception flaws aside, the iPhone 4 is a great showcase for Apple?s technological and design prowess., The combination of the new iOS 4 operating system and a noticeably faster processor than the 3GS make using it a very smooth and enjoyable experience., ?
The new 3.5-inch Retina Display is another big improvement over the 3GS ? and all other mobile devices for that matter., With an 800:1 contrast ratio and 960x640p resolution ? according to Apple, that?s more than the human eye can process at that size of screen ? the Retina Display sets a new benchmark for mobile screens., ?
The Retina Display is a joy to use indoors and at most outdoor light levels, although it becomes reflective and difficult to admire when in direct, bright sunlight such as we?re having recently., Although adding a gratifying pop to images and videos, older applications and their icons can also appear dated and grainy on the new high-res screen ? app developers will have to improve their wares for the iPhone 4., They?ll also have to adapt their apps to allow them to be part of the newly added multi-tasking in iOS 4., ?
Bringing the iPhone 4 to life is the same sprightly Apple A4 processor found in the iPad., You?d think that packing this hefty workhorse under the bonnet would drain the battery, but the new iPhone?s battery life is not noticeably diminished from the 3GS, and Apple claims it actually lasts longer., ?
As noted, iOS 4 brings multitasking to the new Apple handset., This feature is reliant on the compatibility of apps, but this should cease to be an issue pretty sharpish: iPhone purchasers are not likely to look kindly on app developers who don?t update to support multitasking., ?
iOS 4 is no one trick pony., The ability to create folders for your apps is another very welcome addition, as is the option to set homescreen images, scrapping the any-colour-as-long-as-it?s-black background of previous models., ?
iBooks makes the jump from iPad to iPhone with the arrival of iOS 4 and thanks to the iPhone 4?s Retina Display offers up text of impeccable clarity., Crystal-clear fonts similarly enhance web browsing, email and all other text-based functionality., The addition of iBooks will no doubt be a further cause to the iPhone?s success with the commuter market., ?
Following repeated cries from consumers, the iPhone 4 now offers flash., No, not the Adobe version for viewing web video ? that?s just not gonna happen, so get used to it ? but a scorchingly bright LED flash to accompany the improved camera., Stills are not suddenly of compact camera quality, but they are undeniably better, and bigger at five megapixels., Video is much improved, with 720p HD video offers pristine and sharp detail on the Retina Display, though some detail seems to be lost when compressing for direct uploading to YouTube., In-camera editing is also straightforward, and you can add the iMovie app (?2.99) if you want more sophisticated editing of your clips., ?
In addition to the main, rear camera there?s a second, front-facing one., This offers decent picture quality, but it?s there for more than just vanity?s sake., Apple, you see, is attempting to transform video calling from its current status as the forgotten starlet of the tech world into a must-have feature., To this end, it?s included the Skype-style Face Time app., Given that this works only over Wi-Fi and only between one iPhone 4 and another, we can?t see it reviving video calling?s fortunes, somehow, but it does work nicely enough, with much better video quality than on earlier mobile systems., ?
The Apple iPhone 4 is another classic slice of Apple., In just 12 months Steve Jobs and his band have again redefined mobile handsets., From the simply beautiful Retina Display to the addition of HD video, and from the idiot-proof UI to the attempted reinvention of video calling, the Apple iPhone 4 is a majestic piece of kit that will no doubt steal hearts., As long as that signal-loss issue doesn?t prove to be a killer, anyway?

?, WE SAYDespite the problems, the iPhone 4 is a new benchmark in the mobile market and one the will undoubtedly prove popular with consumers, Get T3 on your iPad, Best Satnav reviews, Best Radio reviews, Best Camcorder reviews, Best Smartphone reviews, Best Projector reviews, Vote now and win an iPad!, comments(), Adam Koblenz said on 22 Tuesday 2010 pm30 12:40 pm:, uhh how bout the fact that apple told us both phones would be available on 6/24 and then, without a word, pulled the white one., now they're limiting supply until well after the launch date, with no comments about it whatsoever., that's a really serious PR snafu, imo, and quite frustrating, Comments are closed for this entry, ?Next??, If you want a screen that is TRULY scratch and damage resistant, the Motorola i1 is your baby., It can even withstand blowing rain of 70 mph., iPhone4 cannot even make good phone calls because it's so poorly designed., TheKurgan: If you want a screen that is TRULY scratch and, Share it, Go to the blog about good news and find out that when we buy this stuff some poor Chinese person is working 16 hours a day for 20 cents an hour., If Steve Jobs had any spine he would build these things in the USA and put some americans to work., Don't buy these things you are hurting people., Roy_Merritt_old_car_guy: Go to the blog about good news and find out, Share it, Share it, 2G rocks- still plugging away,being very popular with the retro crowd is just a bonus., 24fans: 2G rocks- still plugging away,being very popular with the retro, Share it, I don't even know why I am writing this, but I just wonder whether people have noticed that Apple, once a company that made personal computers, has transforme?d itself into a company that makes portable devices for a mass market., Everything they do is geared towards satisfying that market, the exclusive deal with AT&T being the obvious exception., They are not making devices to out-nerd your friends., They are making hardware and interfaces that are suited for ordinary consumers., The products are not garbage, they are the best money can buy for the intended market., Based on the market response to the iPod, iPhone, and iPad they have been wildly successful?., The "shortcomi?ngs" mentioned in this post and the criticisms voiced in the comments do not even come close to changing that., Most people who own Apple products are very happy with them., Look at me for instance: I am in the market for a new MP3 player., I will buy an iPod?not a Zune, not a whatever., I trust that when I do I will have something that works, and that has infrastruc?ture (iTunes) to support it., It's all about the interface and the user experience?, and Apple rules on that point., SFTor: I don't even know why I am writing this, but, Share it, I'm happy with it., But I did my homework before buying it., The EVO's nice too., A guy could geek out with either one!, Pectin: I'm happy with it., But I did my homework before, Share it, EVO 4G = real..., iPhone 4G = just a name., TheKurgan: EVO 4G = real..., iPhone 4G = just a name., Share it, it is not called iphone 4g, its called iphone 4...., like the guy you replied to..., do your homework!!?!, jose_garza: it is not called iphone 4g, its called iphone 4...., Share it, the camera isn't the best but everyone is ripping on apple/ipho?nes and i think they're the best..way better than blackberry?., i pre-ordere?d the white one unlocked from gsmauthori?ty.com so i guess i shouldn't talk bc i haven't used it yet, but i have used many of apples electronic?s and they work wonderfull?y., Samm_37: the camera isn't the best but everyone is ripping on, Share it, Hey Samm, You bet!, This is a master piece., I picked up a White 32GB NEW Unlocked at:
http://iph?one-phone.?com/apple-?iphone-4-b?lack.php for $741.00 and it's working like
a charm., I haven't experience?d any of the problems mentioned here period!, This is a master piece., Share it, I am fed up of this network problem with the iPhone 4., It makes me so irritating that i feel like throwing it in a scrap., Why this Apple people's don't test their gadgets first, before launching it in market., I mean this is just a silly issue., motorolaVE440: I am fed up of this network problem with the, Share it, Y'know what makes me so irritatiin?g?, Pectin: Y'know what makes me so irritatiing?, Share it, It ceases to work as a phone when you hold it to your ear., It ceases to work as a phone when you, Share it, i'm seriously annoyed that i spent the time to preorder and then to receive a vmail saying that they'll let me know when i can come in to pick up my phone., xoxotoki: i'm seriously annoyed that i spent the time to preorder, Share it, The absolute worse thing is the new end user agreement which allows them to spy on our movements., I really hate when companies steal my privacy., Christopher_Daley: The absolute worse thing is the new end user agreement, Share it, I agree - there's no benefit to the user to store and access that data., I expect it's used for their benefit/pr?ofit., Too big of a privacy breach for me to overcome., aafoster: I agree - there's no benefit to the user to, Share it, Worse yet, they can distribute that informatio?n to spammers (I'm sure they'd call them ad partners, but it's spam none the less), and it opens doors for some hacker to steal personal informatio?n., jojo911: Worse yet, they can distribute that information to spammers (I'm, Share it, I REALLY do like the new feature of stacking Apps on top of each other and making one App with multiples within., It cleaned up and organized all my Apps nicely., So far no complains with the new OS for me on my G3S, Appletart: I REALLY do like the new feature of stacking Apps, Share it, I updated my 3G (yeah, I've almost had it for 2 years, gasp!) and no joke, this thing is slow as hell now., Never had a problem before iOS4., Now everything is clunky and the worst part is you don't even get the cool new wallpapers on 3G., facepalm12: I updated my 3G (yeah, I've almost had it for, Share it, It could be that iOS4 is optimized for the iPhone 4 and its more powerful CPU., Hopefully they'll update it to run better on older iPhones., jojo911: It could be that iOS4 is optimized for the iPhone, Share it, Yikes, don't people get that Apple is getting PAID by AT+T and making huge profits from this deal?!, Apple has gone from being a true innovator in the early days to a master manipulato?r of Steve's zombie army of "sophistic?ated elite" consumers., Why allow you to watch free flash content when the zombies will PAY for apps., Why release all the new features at once, when you can parcel them out one by one knowing the zombies will throw away their old one to stand in line to buy the new one (coming soon - an iPad that prints!, Then one that multi-task?s!, Then one with a camera!)  AT+T is simply paying Apple to force Steve's zombie army to use their crappy service, we'll see if the talk of the iPhone being available with other providers actually happens, or if it's a PR rumor to sell more iPhones., Infostream: Yikes, don't people get that Apple is getting PAID by, Share it, Yeah, well, that's just like, your opinion, man..., Mr_Lebowski: Yeah, well, that's just like, your opinion, man..., Share it, Okay first off i wanted to state that i am with sprint and i currently own the HTC Evo 4g., Now i have never owned an iphone but thats not to say i dont admire it, and hey if it was on sprint i would swoop it up., Problem is At&t 130 for what i get on Sprint for 70....with insurance., Apple does control...?.but this is a business move., Cant replace the battery because a third party would make the battery cheaper and die sooner., Apple makes quality and doesnt want to compete with third party cheap parts thus having to compromise their products., This is why no phone will stand up to apple., The iphone 4 still isnt as fast as the HTC Evo but its way user friendly and trendy to boot., Ill just wait til it comes to sprint thank you., WhistleWhilst: Okay first off i wanted to state that i am, Share it, Not one of these is a serious concern., They sure are selling a lot of phones for such a piece of junk., RandomCommenter2: Not one of these is a serious concern., Share it, Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus combined have sold over 100 million records., AmandaBC: Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus combined have sold over 100, Share it, Who said those two were great singers?, They are/were teen idols, not true singers., I never saw anyone not being paid by them claim they could sing., I could go on about that but it's unrelated so I'll just leave it at that., jojo911: Who said those two were great singers?, They are/were teen, Share it, There are More Comments on this Thread., Click Here To See them All, ?Next??, 9 comments Add a Comment (Log in or register)  (9 Comments)  prev next, by  June 22, 2010 8:40 PM PDT  Did someone receive a white iPhone 4???, by AndroidFTW June 22, 2010 10:21 PM PDT  No Google Voice app on iPhone , poor notification system , not true multitasking...iPhone ?No thanks.Euge bezel...dinky screen., This is 2010...where is the beef ?, 1 person likes this comment, As if your dislike matters to the 600,000 folks who pre-ordered the phone without ever seeing it or touching it., We could rip the Android to shreds too, but at the end of the day, you use what you like., Since you felt you had to come on here a take shots at the iPhone, you just identified it as the benchmark to beat, so thanks for that!, by cardfan1212 June 23, 2010 5:42 AM PDT  How come CNET didn't post a review yet?, Apple not deem you guys worthy this year?, by uptown187 June 23, 2010 8:49 AM PDT  they should have did like willie wonker and the chocolate factory and put 1 white phone in the shipment., WHom ever gets it wins luch with Steve Jobs., Whonder how many Iphones they would have sold then!, Bet ATT servers would have fried., by rc9155 June 23, 2010 9:33 AM PDT  Apple iphone 4, I received mine today (6-23-10) by 10:00am., Mr Jobs, it's the phone of the century, classy in all it boasts'., Just a few microscopic minus things, viz., 1) The top and bottom black borders could have been reduced and display size incresed to 3.8., 3) Internal storage increased to 64GB., Regardless a superb device you just want hold in your hand and cuddle it., by alexdethier June 23, 2010 10:42 AM PDT  iOS 4 is a huge improvement over 3., Running apps in the background makes switching much more bearable., Also, playing apps like Spawn HD on the new screen is just fantastic., Cant' wait to see what's next!, by Kberry87 June 23, 2010 11:13 AM PDT  Just got my iPhone delivered from AT&T..., I love it!, I activated it, but can't plug into iTunes until I go home..., I love the weight and feel of the new design!!!, Add a comment, Click here to add another comment., The Apple fear factor, Level 3: Comcast is strong-arming us, The posting of advertisements, profanity, or personal attacks is prohibited., Click here to review our Terms of Use., The Good Retina Display is beautiful, clear to read Much-improved cameras Much faster web browsing iOS 4 support Improved battery life The Bad Still exclusive to AT&T in the U.S., Limited to 32GB Reception issues Not necessarily a must-have upgrade The Price $199 ? 16GB model $299 ? 32GB model Both require two-year AT&T contract While the last iPhone ? the 3GS ? hung its hat on the speed improvements it offered over previous models, for the iPhone 4, it?s all about the visuals.From the phone?s groundbreaking Retina Display screen to its 5-megapixel camera, from HD video recording to FaceTime video calls, the iPhone 4?s top features are all visual., Despite the improvements the iPhone 4 offers, it?s not a big enough step forward to be a must-have upgrade., Screens and Cameras Apple touts its Retina Display screen as having the same resolution as the human eye., I?m not qualified to take on the human-eye statement, but this is easily the best screen I?ve seen on a smartphone., The screen uses a denser pixel arrangement ? though they have the same size screen, the iPhone 4 is 960 x 480, the 3GS is 480 x 320 ? to create more-detailed images and text., As a result, text is sharper and easier to read than on any other phone I?ve seen., You?ll notice the improved text quality most when reading emails, websites, or books via apps like Kindle or iBooks., Reading on the relatively small screen of the smartphone is now much more pleasant., While the screen is a breakthrough, the iPhone 4 also adds some long-desired camera features, including a 5-megapixel camera and camera flash, which produce great-looking images., Beyond those additions, Apple equipped the iPhone 4 with two cameras., The back camera records 720p HD video, while the user-facing camera is used with the FaceTime video chat feature., FaceTime?s limitations make it more for show than daily use right now, but it?s pretty neat., With the improved camera, and the ability to edit video via the included app or Apple?s iMovie app, the iPhone is a much more appealing photo- and video-creation tool.Given that users can shoot HD video on the phone, though, the 32GB memory limit is a disappointment., 32GB will fill up fast with HD video., Hopefully we'll soon see a revision offering 64GB of storage., Faster, Faster While the visual changes are the biggest, the iPhone 4 gets some nice under-the-hood improvements that produce speedier performance, too., This is the first iPhone to employ Apple?s A4 processor, which was introduced in the iPad., Generally, the new processor provides a moderate speed increase over the iPhone 3GS., In testing the 4 and 3GS side by side, the iPhone 4 is clearly a step or two faster in launching apps., The biggest speed improvement comes in the iPhone 4?s web operations., To compare the 4 and 3GS, I tested how long it took each to load three popular websites over the 3G network and WiFi., In both cases the iPhone 4 came out the clear winner., Over 3G, with the iPhone 4 listed first below, the times were: CNN.com: 9 seconds vs., The 4 didn?t blow the 3GS away over the 3G network, but it?s certainly faster., WiFi, however, shows real improvements., The times there were: CNN.com: 4 seconds vs., As you can see, the iPhone 4 is much faster on the web than its predecessor, making for a much more pleasant experience.Steadily Improving BatteryWhile it?s never been a battery powerhouse, Apple has steadily improved the iPhone battery with every new model., That continues to be true with the iPhone 4., In my testing, I was able to get 35 consecutive hours of music playback out of the iPhone 4, a testing period that included phone calls, email, and other regular uses., This is definitely better than the iPhone 3GS, which I found to have a battery that would give roughly a day or day and a half of life before needing a recharge., Nagging Reception Issues Perhaps the most well-known problem with the iPhone 4 are the reception issues that can be caused by placing a hand or finger over the antenna on the left-hand side of the phone., Despite claims by Apple that this is primarily a cosmetic issue, not a functional one, testing by many parties has concluded that the issue is in fact a flaw in the phone., Signal strength does seem to drop when touched by skin, though it only seems to become a real problem if you?re already in a low-signal-strength area., I haven?t been able to reproduce the problem, which seems to suggest that not all phones are affected., Still, covering the antenna with tape or a case can go a long way towards reducing the seriousness of the problem., This problem may not be completely fixed until there?s a revision to the iPhone 4, or maybe even the next-generation iPhone, but we?ll see.The Bottom LineThe iPhone 4 is a terrific package., It offers major upgrades over the 3GS in the areas of display, camera, speed, and battery., If you don?t have an iPhone, or have the original iPhone or iPhone 3G, this is probably a must-have upgrade ? especially since it runs iOS 4 and takes advantage of its many excellent features., However, if you?ve got a 3GS, I?m not sure you need to upgrade unless you love gadgets and want the latest and greatest., The 3GS runs iOS 4, too, so you get those benefits., Unless you?ve got eyesight that will benefit from the new screen or are itchy to make mobile video, this is an optional upgrade., Regardless, Apple?s hit another home run with the iPhone 4 (as its tremendous first-weekend sales proved)., User Reviews?5 out of 5"I love my iPhone 4 I have not experienced a single dropped call", Member BitzobritI love my iPhone 4., I have not experienced a single dropped call and its new Retina Display is to die for., I am very happy with its battery life and it never lags or freezes up., I love FaceTime and t?MoreWrite a reviewSee all 2 reviews

		The iPhone 4's look can be described in one word: stylish., Whereas the iPhone 3GS looks and feels plasticky, the iPhone 4 is svelte and has a premium feel., Surprisingly, it achieves that impression while retaining the same general design, although the edges appear a bit more squared than before., It's noticeably slimmer than the iPhone 3GS, measuring 0.37 inch deep versus the iPhone 3GS's thickness of 0.48 inch (that translates to 24 percent less)., The iPhone 4 is also slightly narrower, 2.31 inches to 2.44 inches., The weight stays the same at 4.8 ounces, but the tweaks to the dimensions make the iPhone 3GS seem almost blocky in comparison., However, it's the aesthetic design touches that make the iPhone 4 an upgrade from the 3GS., The overall design screams elegance--from the rounded, individual volume up and down buttons that replace the plastic volume rocker on the iPhone 3GS to the ring/silent switch and the power/sleep button up top., The face and back are made of glass that is specially treated to withstand scratches and oily fingers, according to Apple., Despite the company's claims, though, I found that both the front and back of my review unit were ridden with fingerprints after only a couple of hours of use., The side edging is stainless steel, and doubles as the device's three cellular and wireless antennas., At the iPhone 4 launch, Steve Jobs proclaimed that this new design would improve wireless reception., Hooray, we thought--until we heard about its serious design flaw., When you hold a phone, you're sometimes inclined to grip it by its edges., But if you hold the iPhone 4 by its edges, your fingers might block its antennas, thus seriously degrading the wireless connectivity., Senior Editor Mark Sullivan conducted a series of data tests around San Francisco to see how much the connectivity was affected by this, ahem, design fail., In the majority of his tests, he saw dramatic decreases in connectivity., The company essentially suggests that users not hold the phone in that way., Gorgeous Display
		Of course, the iPhone 4 isn't just about cosmetic enhancements, pleasing as they are., What makes this phone such a technological improvement is what's inside the handset., Like its predecessor, the iPhone 4 has a 3.5-inch display., But the new phone's screen doubles the resolution to a 960-by-640-pixel IPS display., At 326 pixels per inch, this is the highest resolution available on a phone to date., That display truly makes a difference., Whereas the iPhone 3GS's text--in the menus, in apps, or on Web pages--appears thick, fuzzy, and undefined, the iPhone 4's text is razor sharp, even when enlarged (as we tried doing when viewing a PDF)., The new "Retina display"--so named because it surpasses the number of pixels that the human retina can process--also greatly improves the sharpness, clarity, and visible detail of images., In both cases, we'd liken the magnitude of difference to that between a standard-definition 480p DVD and a high-definition 1080p Blu-ray Disc: When you view both on an HDTV, the differences are striking., And once you see them, you can't go back., The real value of the new display will become evident for people who spend time reading on the iPhone 4., We expect that the display will make reading a more pleasurable experience (although, clearly, limits will remain given the inherently modest screen size--modest, at least, as compared with handsets such as the HTC EVO 4G, which has a 4.3-inch screen, and with the much larger 9.7-inch iPad screen)., iOS 4: Best Features
		The iPhone 4 uses Apple's A4 CPU, the same processor powering the Apple iPad., It runs the newly renamed iOS 4 operating system (which the iPad will also use, starting in the fall)., As part of iOS 4, the iPhone 4 gains a bevy of capabilities., One of them--multitasking--is long overdue, but as with the long-awaited cut-and-paste feature, Apple delivers on the promise of making multitasking work smoothly., You quickly double-tap on the home button to pull up a pane that shows which apps are open., From there, you can swipe horizontally through the apps that the iPhone 4 has retained in either a running or suspended state., When you find the app you want, you just click on the icon., The app will then resume its activity, and, if written to take advantage of this new feature, it will pick up precisely where you left off., At the very least, reaccessing the app will be faster., Equally as elegant as multitasking is Apple's implementation of Folders, an increasingly necessary addition., To add icons into a folder, you simply drag one icon on top of another to create the folder, which automatically gets the name of the category those apps share--or, if you prefer, you can rename the folder on the spot., You can pack a maximum of 12 apps within a single folder (giving you three rows of four apps across the home screen)., And, thanks to the addition of Folders, you can now add up to a maximum of 2160 apps., Dramatic Camera Boost
		The iPhone 4 brings much-desired camera and video recording advances, as well., The primary camera on the back bumps up from 3 megapixels to 5 megapixels, while retaining the same pixel size (which can further improve image quality)., The camera also gains an LED flash, a backlit sensor, and an integrated 5X zoom., The camera now lets you shoot in high-def, at 720p, 30 frames per second; in addition, video gains the tap-to-focus feature already available on the still camera., PCWorld's testing methodology for the iPhone 4's camera (as well three Android smartphones) was a truncated version of our regular testing methodology for point-and-shoot cameras., We affixed each phone to a tripod and shot two images with the flash turned off:, A target chart and printed text to evaluate sharpness and distortion levels., Here's evidence that megapixel counts rarely matter: Apple's 5-megapixel iPhone 4 beat out the other smartphones we tested for overall image quality, serving up well-exposed, brightly colored images., However, the iPhone 4's image quality did lag behind the competition in two categories, sharpness and visible distortion., We tested the camcorder capabilities of the iPhone 4 (along with those same three Android smartphones) in the same way we test pocket digital camcorders., Lab Manager Tony Leung recorded a 1-minute video of a toy train and Ferris wheel to gauge several aspects of the video quality: smoothness of motion, color accuracy, and artifacting., We shot the same scene twice, with each device in the same tripod location at its highest video-quality setting--once in bright indoor lighting, and again with the overhead lights turned off and a floor lamp turned on behind the phone., Once we shot all of the footage, our panel of judges rated each clip for its overall quality., For more, read our full report, "Smartphone Camera Battle: iPhone 4 vs., the Android Army.", Unfortunately, we didn't get to fully test the front-facing camera, another addition to the iPhone 4., This camera is integral to Apple's FaceTime videophone app, which works only for communicating between two iPhone 4 handsets., Improved Voice and Data Over AT&T
		Bad-sounding and dropped voice calls are one of the biggest gripes of iPhone users here in San Francisco., Fortunately, the iPhone 4's new antenna seemed to improve the experience considerably., In almost all the test calls we placed around the city, calls on the iPhone 4 sounded better than calls on the new Motorola Droid X., Calls sounded more natural, and were more pleasing to listen to on the other end of the line., We recorded no dropped calls on AT&T., In our informal performance testing in San Francisco, the AT&T-connected iPhone 4 registered an average download speed of 1958 kbps (almost 2 mbps) across our five testing locations in the city., In our head-to-head tests with the Motorola Droid X on Verizon, the iPhone 4 was the clear winner in speed., The two new devices posted similar average upload speeds; the iPhone 4 registered 434 kbps and the Droid X averaged 564 kbps., Those upload speeds are fast enough to support basic file sharing but not enough to make fat-pipe apps such as multiplayer gaming or videoconferencing run well., The iPhone 4 is a must-have for anyone with an original iPhone or iPhone 3G (the former won't get the iOS 4 upgrade at all, while the 3G won't support some features)., And people who have an iPhone 3GS will find this a worthy upgrade, too., Unlike the previous jump, from the iPhone 3G to the 3GS--which focused on slight performance improvements--the iPhone 4 bolsters the hardware's digital imaging capabilities and its display, making it a comprehensive and measurable upgrade over its predecessor., But the iPhone 4 isn't the only hot phone this summer--some enticing Android-powered smartphones are out there, as well., If you're fed up with AT&T's service issues or want to try something beyond the Apple universe, check out the HTC EVO 4G on Sprint, the Motorola Droid X on Verizon, and the Samsung Galaxy S phones coming to all four major carriers., Already own it?, Posting comment ..., PCWorld's 32GB iPhone 4 Coverage, Verizon's First LTE Smartphone an IPhone?, Google Voice Finally Finds a Home on iPhone, iPhone Passes Blackberry in Global Shipments, 5 Reasons to Buy a Verizon iPhone, Apple's Path to iPhone Redemption Runs through Verizon, iPhone Users Most Satisfied, But Others Also Happy, When to Use the iPhone 4's HDR Feature, Don?t Hold Your Breath for Verizon iPhone, says CEO, Cisco Flip Makes Easy Videos, But Smartphones Do More, AT&T Led More to Avoid iPhone 4 Than 'Antennagate', Poll Says, Third Time's a Charm: iOS 4.1 Will Finally Fix iPhone 4, Will the iPhone Morph into the 'iWallet'?, Compare the Apple 32GB iPhone 4, We recommend these Phones for their similarities to the Apple 32GB iPhone 4 in features, specs, ratings, and user interest., The iPhone 4 is a major upgrade from its predecessor, the iPhone 3GS, in everything from the camera quality to data speeds., 2863 users want this Read more ?, The standout of the Galaxy S phones, the Epic 4G offers some enticing features like a physical keyboard, front-facing camera and 4G network support., 1026 users want this Read more ?, The powerful myTouch 4G delivers when it comes to multimedia and performance, but make sure you live in an HSPA+-supported area before purchasing it., 197 users want this Read more ?, The speedy HTC EVO 4G packs in some powerful specs and a variety of multimedia features into a stylish, minimalist design, but not everybody will get to enjoy one of its best features--4G connectivity., 2086 users want this Read more ?, The iPhone 4 is a major upgrade from its predecessor, the iPhone 3GS, in everything from the camera quality to data speeds., 2863 users want this Read more ?, Motorola Droid X shines at multimedia playback, network performance, and features;

StumbleUpon, No-one cares anymore, MG., You're a shill with no objective judgement., I think Leo Laporte was able to give a much more honest review than this., I think I just threw up a little., Steve Jobs called., He said his son should come home now., Great review MG, waiting Android fanboys (or anti-apple fanboys),,, "But what?s even crazier about FaceTime is that Apple says they will open source the technology ? something which Apple doesn?t often do., If third-party developers choose to utilize it, it could be really  interesting." 
Exactly., The notion of an open standard protocol (Face Time) for video calls that compels a simple user experience is what excites me the most about Apple right now., If you recall recent remarks from Cisco, they too see Apple as (probably) the only company with the clarity to make video calls a scenario that is not clunky, nerdy, or obtuse., Apple is bringing sexy back to video chat., Also, I want a harpoon gun as well., Pointless fanboy post., thought it was an objective review., it has a few flaws and will be taken care of., antenna issues aside, it's a great phone., android has its fanboys and i use both phones and enjoy both platforms., and the google voice app works on it right?, Fanboyism means mindlessly ignoring flaws, which you did., How can a cellphone, which has connection issues making calls, be the best cellphone?, Can you answer that MG?, Don't like it?, Don't read it., It's funny how you got so many downranks for that., It's clearly because more Android fanboys come onto Apple posts to hate than Apple fanboys come onto Android posts to hate., Clearly some insecurities going on with their love of Android?, What's the point of writing negative comments on this post when the headline says it all?, I've never used it but think people are still extremely bitter about your EVO review, MG., In my opinion people should just buy one now., You'd have it for at least 6 more months in any case., And if it does indeed come to Verizon next January, if its the same phone it will be 6 months old by then., So if you really want to wait for Verizon, you might as well just wait a full year until the next iPhone comes out., At that point, you'd have waited a year, which is way too long., Did CDMA technology resolve issue with voice and 3g data at the same time?, Could be really tough to move to Verizon after having few months of getting used that data and voice can come together?, Whose that desi chic?she's hot, The iPhone is certainly a quality device, perhaps the best out there, but the completely rapturous tone and hyperbole makes MG's opinion pretty much worthless., This is in no way the biggest leap for an iPhone generation., Remember a little thing called the App Store?, if youre a fanboy ok!, but dont be a reviewer because people that tell others what to buy can not be biased !, i have iPhone, it sucks, "they may have took charge" 
Gah!, You guys need to hire a proofreader., I almost want to switch to an Android for an official Google Voice app., they are the second to bring it, if you even count video chat over wifi only as being comparable., I appreciated that the review began with MG Siegler stating that he is biased., (So why criticize him?) I liked the side-by-side comparisons., I also liked information about what was noticeably faster and better., I still won't buy an iPhone4 because of the antenna/software/whatever problems., There's a psychology to every major purchase and Apple blew it., I wasn't aware there was a first in the category of non-contrived user experiences for video chat?, (yep, I'm being serious!), Where did you get that price range from?, I've never, ever, seen any iphone for less than $300; If you show me where I can get an iphone 4 for $300, I'll buy one on the spot!, Since the first iPhone, subsequent generations have not made very many advances, mostly filling in areas of weakness., The app store has clearly influenced the design of most major smartphones., The author is spot on., I bought my son a iPhone 4 and my 3GS pales in comparison., What's the point of a "review" if we already know you love it despite it's fundamental suckiness as a PHONE., Apple doesn's sell it as a "Mobile Device." They sell it as a PHONE., Nobody has ever said a single iPhone is a great PHONE., Wake up you idots., I always appreciate these reviews, MG., As someone who is an iPhone lover (who fell in love with it because of the experience, not because of a previous Mac allegiance), I'm always interested in how an iPhone fan compares the experience to other phones., All that I got from this post: *YOU* recommend the iPhone., Tell me something I don't know., On a serious note: no talk about multi tasking?, On how it is better (in your opinion only, obviously) than Android's?, You made a comparison with Android and all you talked about was hardware., The insurmountable amount of subjectivity in this post makes its value be equal to zero., You could have written about ponies and unicorns just as well., How many times are you going to comment on this post?, BTW, i didn't mean to reply to this :O, The iPhone strength is not the phone part but then again this is true for most modern phones ? if you want a good phone go get a 4 year old nokia., Can you please stop talking about at&t ? we people from outside the U.S., actually use the iPhone too., No Google Voice, but in exchange you get to have private information stored as plain text in every iTunes purchase!, I really love the contrast of the white bumper on the black iPhone 4., Leo Laporte is a joke., Great job MG., Android fanbois out in droves haha., + $3000.00 (US) worth of AT&T contract fees., iPod: $250.00 (US) 
Big jump in price to the iPod that makes phone calls if you hold it right., Really good review MG, I enjoyed every single bit of it and agree alot what you say since I have a iPhone 4., Ironically, iPhone 4 is leo's choice of phone right now!, That's a 3g with normal chrome rim., Google voice is my one big regret on the iPhone 4., The web app is weak and I refuse to pay twice for Voice Centrals app!, Apple's approval is still pending though!, Apple will open source the FaceTime technology?, Exactly how does that benefit Apple if any other device can do the same thing considering that FaceTime is the prominent selling feature of the iPhone 4?, MG, you have a very narrow view of the world., You think there are only two companies, apple and google., example: in your last paragraph you say
" It will be fun to watch Android try to answer and see if they can dethrone the king before iPhone 5,"  
which suggests that android is the only competitor to the iphone., Not only has windows phone 7 garnered more excitement than android ever did, but it has proven to be a formidable competitor, as will webOSs next iterations., another fallacy in your article is your continued behavior to bash AT&T., You have this preconceived notion that everyone hates at&t., You honestly believe this and tell yourself this., guess what?, most people like this., I know, it hurts you that youre in the vocal minority that hates at&t, but its true., "If I 100% knew that iphone was launching on at&t, there is no way I would recommend anyone to buy the iPhone 4 right now" 
why not?, you know most people have great service with at&t right?, not everyone lives in san francisco anti-at&t article and open your narrow view on the world., There are bigger and more influential companies than apple and google., At&t  covers virtually all americans and has the fastest speeds., Most people outside of silicon valley are satisfied with at&t., Most iphone users wouldn't even notice any OS changes., Most users WILL notice the antenna issue, you can blame that on ATT if you like., Comparing the camera to an S90?, I'm surprised you didn't praise the amazing video editing software, w/ the new powerful iphone hardware, it rivals my quadcore mac tower!, Hoes that iPhone 4 working for you in Israel?, Oh wait?, It scares me that this is what passes for analysis today., I was on the fence about upgrading to the iPhone 4., Many of my geekier (and trust worthy) friends have been trying to woo me toward Andorid devices saying it would be "right up my alley" ., But, I have to admit, the thing that convinced me to stick with apple and upgrade was MG's short review a few months ago, after playing with the phone at WWDC., Hater's are gonna hate ? but I like Mr., Siegler's enthusiasm., Nice review MG., I know I would buy the iPhone if I actually needed a phone., Maybe all these users giving negative comments just to do it could put their time to more useful things like contributing a better UI or fixing crashes in the Android apps they praise., 1
This is supposed to be a tech site., I really can?t see how people can take any of your reviews seriously., This review sounds more like it was written by a soccer mom than someone with technical credibility., I think I?ll give techcrunch a miss for now., So Google Voice is now THE feature that defines whether a smartphone is good or not?, No, Google Voice doesn't work on Apple's iPhone., You should look to Google's Android phones for that specific app., And FaceTime works on your Android phone of course, right?, Well considering the whole disapointing antenna bamboozle I'm not suprised Apple still needs testers and will let you keep the phone for free afterwards
tinyurl.com/testkeep-iphone4
A free phone is much more worth your while regardless of how it stacks up against Android
-Just my two cents
Guilio, Maybe I'm missing something, but I'm not seeing a whole lot of Android "fanboy" post., Especially in relation to the last time, so what are you talking about., I think most Android users are simply just passing on this one to avoid getting his hits up., What makes you assume they were android fans?, I usually ignore your iPhone/Android posts because you seem rather ignorant on the subject and I rather do something more productive w/ my time., But your last line deserves a response, Android OS passed the iPhone OS at 2.1, and then overlapped it in 2.2., The manufactures make 15-20 phones a year, Apple makes 1, so yeah obviously Apple can spend more time optimizing their phone, but who cares., Quick example, Apple spends their time and money optimizing the Macs, but they will never put a dent in Windows share., Another example is the Nexus One, Google optimization and the hardware they chose, and you know what happen it was a superb phone., I would even say its better then the iPhone, the Nexus One clearly shows what Android is capable of when implemented correctly., And hopefully the Notion Ink Adam will be another great example, I really hope they take the Android OS and completely revamp it for tablet mode., The same way open-sourcing WebKit benefits them., Not only has windows phone 7 garnered more excitement than android ever did, but it has proven to be a formidable competitor, as will webOSs next iterations., Windows phone 7 isn't even out yet, how is it a formidable competitor?, Apple fanboys dont read blogs, they enjoy their phone., I?m a big fan of iPhone and you?ve been my favorite writer on TC., But I?ll have to give this article a ?D? for dull., You can?t win ?em all :), AND HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO ORGANIZE YOUR ICONS THE SAME WAY ON TWO IPHONES?, This is my biggest beef with iPhone., Otherwise I agree with your post., I am surprised that as an iPhone lover you reached this conclusion., Other than the display, what is radical about the iPhone 4 to make you fall in love with it., I have argued elsewhere how Apple missed the boat with iPhone 4., Compared to 3GS the improvement is in terms of the cosmetics (glass body, antennae, etc.), facetime, camera, and some RAM and processing power., Given that iPhone has a 1 year development cycle, little increases in RAM, battery life, camera, processing speed is nothing spectacular., In fact, it is nothing out of ordinary and there are other phones that have most of these features and even more., As regards Facetime,  it is not very useful currently., You can only use it on iPhone 4 and how many of your contacts have one., It is ironic that Apple had to set up helplines for people to test Facetime, as not many people could use it in any meaningful ways., Finally, the cosmetics, which you have made a great deal about, is far from perfect., The glass screen shatters, scratches., The device does not work as a phone (due to the faulty antennae)., What is wrong with you?common stop praising Apple for the wrong reasons., I have been an Apple fan myself, but I was terribly disappointed with iPhone 4., The review might be slightly bias, but he's still right., The iPhone 4 is the best phone on the market right now both from both a hardware and software stand-point., The media, and Android fanboys are all jumping up and down about the antenna issue which is an issue with ALL mobile phones, including every Android phone that's ever shipped., The iPhone 4 outperforms the 3GS in every way, and I've had significantly less dropped calls., This phone actually has the best antenna of any phone I've ever used., My Mom is on Verizon and they sold her an Android phone, and after two month's she's still struggling to figure it out., She hate's it and is actually going to sell it., She was so frustrated with it the other day I handed her my iPhone and she figured it out immediately., Not to mention the App Store is so massive, and there are so many amazing apps for the iPhone nothing will ever come close., Lastly, iTunes is the number 1 music service and Android users cannot take their iTunes with them., I no longer need any other device., Android fan's can't even say that unless they've never bought a song from the iTunes Music Store, and never experienced the plethora of applications available for the iPhone., It's really rather sad that so many people have latched onto such an inferior mobile OS because they don't like Apple, rather than reasonably and logically looking at the ease of use and availability of the iPhone, App Store, and iTunes., Android doesn't come close in any of these aspects., "Not only has windows phone 7 garnered more excitement than android ever did?" 
If your goal was to make people laugh their asses off, you succeeded!, I will admit that Windows 7 looks somewhat enticing, at the very least the interface is very original and not just another iPhone clone., That said, no one has actually used the OS yet, so we'll really have to wait and see., But your statement that Windows 7 has more excitement around it than Android is simply ridiculous., Agree, this review was not necessary., I didn't even read it, as I already know exactly what it says ? which is exactly why it should never have been written., I wish Arrington would fire MG already, his pointless articles about how awesome Apple is really bring this site down., Do it., It's great., I've been using GV since November and love it!, > Google Voice doesn't work on Apple's iPhone 
The sad thing is that it DOES work ? Apple just wouldn't approve it, so no one gets to use it., One reason among many that I will never give another penny to Apple ever again., One of the most pointless things I've ever read., Hell, we know you like the iPhone., How about a review from someone who isn't ridiculously biased?, As for the screen, if you have to hold up an old iPhone to ensure people realise the the difference, do they REALLY need the improvement?, Pointless improvement tbf., Could you just give some examples of "things you can do on the device with such ease that are kind of a pain in the ass on Android."?, I've never used an iPhone on a daily basis but I feel this statement needs a few examples for it to be justified., I understand Apple is offering refunds now., Need we progress beyond that?, Apple's little press release says they're "shocked" to realize their horrible little phone, that I paid a fortune for over two years, hasn't been properly registering the signal strength all along? not just the current new release., Everytime I see an insipid article such as this one extolling its many features and remember not being able to make a call? 
?I'm reminded of a graphic artist friend of mine who spent a student loan fortune on an Apple system back in the day and proudly tried to show it off to me one evening at his home., It kept crashing the whole evening and I, being a good guest, had to keep smiling and listening to him praise Apple products., It was ludicrous., Seems like nothing has changed., windows phone 7 comes out in 3 months., why would you not even mention it considering its the first competition to the iphone ever., there's a barf bag for that., i think they're here :), Bottom line ? If you want to be iSheep get the iPhone., Android delivers everything that the iPhone currently has  + freedom of choice., Does iPhone4 have Wifi Hotspot?, Can I tether from my iPhone to my iPad ? how dumb is that?, But iSheep are too dumb to understand such complex scenarios., 'We don't want a future where one man, one company, one device and one carrier would be our only choice!', Are you left handed?, I am and I?ve always held the phone in my left hand ? the way you are not supposed to according to Jobs and Apple., What do you say to left-handed people as a recommendation?, Change the natural way you hold the device?, Why should we change the way we naturally hold and se the phone in order to achieve connectivity?, with the rise in these new smartphones, most people using the devices for data much more than voice., that's how., well i'm sure they'll get over it eventually :), There is no best device., There's is only a device that's best for you., Wow, the author must get a check from Apple?.., I will say it is a good phone, but when you can't make a call on it, what is the point???, #FAIL  
Oh yeah, and my Evo really does multi-task., Real Linux kernels can do that??, 97% coverage, 90% on Edge data, woot for that 10k/sec data rates., If it does more it does it very slowly., Keep paying your ISP to use the data on your phone., totally sucks., How did this clown get a job at TechCrunch?, I used my iPhones for the past 3 years
Never did I have a drop call in my country Israel and in europe
The iPhone as a PHONE is great
Only the US has this issue
Blame your carrier not the phone, Who freakin care about the review., Whos the hot desi chic on the right of the boat ??, thanks david., Very good assessment of the ?mobile device?; it?s definitely much more than a phone for me., In fact, making/receiving calls is the third or fourth thing on the list of things I do with it., Also, I?m tired of hearing all these people saying how there are other phones that have a better camera, better this, and better that (usually referring to Android phones)., It?s all bullsh*t, I actually got the Evo and aside from the bigger screen, I was disappointed with pretty much all the others aspects of the phone., I?ve always been a PC guy all my life, but having been an iPhone user (my first Apple product), I realize they are superior in quality., By that I mean my iPhone 4 takes better photos than the Evo, eventhough the Evo has more megapixels; and the list goes on., The moral of the story is that just because a product promises to do everything and plays the numbers game (better camera, double flash,etc); doesn?t mean it does any of those things well, or even satisfactorily., Some rep as Best Buy told me how there have been phones that have had foward-facing cameras and do videoconferencing before the iPhone 4, and I said ?Yes, I know, only they are the most ridiculous things to use and the quality of the calls are so bad it?s not worth it.?  The devil is in the details, and execution., I wish other companies would do the same, maybe Apple would have a real competitor which is a good thing for us the consumer., sure, app store overall bigger ? but that's not a hardware change, obviously., you bet., way too much to ask., Every 720p video I have seen posted by the iPhone4, seems to be dropping frames., Are there any videographers here who care to comment?, For Flickr, check out Mobile Fotos., Much better than the Flickr app, imo, and lets you upload photos to Flickr., is just not that cool like the first one, and iphone users will have to be just ok with that ?, When held as Apple recommends, the iPhone 4 actually has better reception quality than any of its predecessors, but it may be giving more problems to left handed users., It takes only a minimal knowledge of radio frequency science to understand why some people have problems when pressing fingers or palms against the bottom left corner of the iPhone 4, while most do not., The phone has two separate external antennas; one for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and GPS, the second for UMTS and GSM., The two antennas are fit closely at the bottom left., Placing a hand or any conductive medium over the point of proximity causes current to  drain from one or both antennas., The drainage from grounding or bridging is low enough not to have a noticeable effect if the incoming signal is strong, but further depletes any weak signal., In my opinion, Apple should have added an insulating layer over the vulnerable section., Easy solutions would be to use an inexpensive case or simply affix some adhesive tape at the phone's lower left corner., Oh come on now, can't we read blogs ON our phone?, "But what?s even crazier about FaceTime is that Apple says they will open source the technology ? something which Apple doesn?t often do." ? Why is everyone surprised by this?, Webkit was open sourced., Darwin was open sourced., Apple doesn't open source their finished products but they regularly open source underlying technology in order to establish standards., Oh you mean that rendering engine they stole from KDE Project and made open source to look like saviors ?, Data drops too., Can u only video call people with iPhone 4 and only on wi-fi?, if so thats pretty lame the EVO wins in that department, I had to stop reading after the douchebags on a boat video., This rumor about an iPhone 4 verizon has been circling around the techblogs., Hopefully, it will be for real this time., Verizon iPhone 4 Updates., Does the iPhone 4 have antenna problems?, Yes, the iPhone 4 has attenuation of reception when held in certain ways, but that arises from physics and is common to all cell phones, and does not indicate any hardware defect in the iPhone 4., The expert views of this are beginning to arrive and are for the most part confirming Apple's "Letter from Apple Regarding iPhone 4."

And it appears that the Nokia E71 and the Droid Incredible experience exactly the same problem of attenuated reception, when held in certain ways, to pretty much the same extent as the iPhone 4., However, those phones have a conventional internal antenna design, yet they experience the same problem, when they are held in a way that brings a human hand in close proximity to their respective internal antennas., See http://www.edibleapple.com/signal-attenuation-is-?., So does the iPhone 4 have a hardware defect that degrades its reception of the radio signals that it is designed to receive?, The answer to that is no., Does the iPhone 4 experience degradation of its radio signals, when in direct or close contact, as is true for all cell phones?, Yes, it does., The answer to both of those last two questions is also no., Fast, stable and no dropped calls in my neck of the woods., And you can actually update the phone to the latest OS which most of the fandroids can?t do with their phones., I?ll take Apple?s ?closed? system over Android?s fragmented, malware filled system any day., If you need a third party app to type on your phone, your phone sucks., Facetime is mostly a software change and you reviewed it., I thought the whole point of being an iPhone guy was thumping the perfectly blended software/hardware experience Apple supposedly offers., I found this to be an intelligent and useful post MG; you're a great writer, and I appreciate the thoughtful 'hit the high points' format of your review., I certainly think that the title "An iPhone Lover?s Take On The iPhone 4" is an adequate disclaimer for any bias as well., :)  
Personally speaking, I prefer the Android platform for a variety of reasons, yet I hope everyone would agree that competition in the market benefits us all as developers and consumers., Except that, as David Pogue, explained in his review NYT of the EVO, its video calling, while listed as feature, either isn't available, because there are so few places where Sprint has a 4G network, or, where both parties are located in Sprint's limited 4G network, simply doesn't work or works badly, so badly that video calling on the EVO is a sham, whereas FaceTime video calling on the iPhone 4 works superbly, when both parties have iPhone 4s and WiFi, which is nearly pervasive, is available., EVO has the feature; the iPhone 4 has the fact., Ahh, the latest episode of "People with Strong Positive Opinions About Reality TV Shows on a Boat" is finally out., This show never gets old., Can't argue with the sales figures., i hate you now
i use nexus one and my wife bought evo
after we read your article we tried iphone
o my  it is so much better
why did we buy nexus and evo?, i hate myself!, my wife may ask for divorse, The only "suckiness" as a phone is the signal degradation due to holding the bottom corner., Solution sucks, but its there., That being said I have no problems making calls on it., No better or worse than my Nokia was on AT&T., i double that, these Apple haters are everywhere, and luckily they r not smart enough or else a lot of awesome writers will be fired, you are my favorite on TC, keep your head up, and dont give a damn to these Apple haters since they always hate anything Apple., Haters are your biggest fans, I swear, I think you have sex with your iphone., Okay, I'm asking this in all seriousness here, how is "can't use because you can only get 10 to 16 hours of battery life" a deal breaker, but "Can't use because it randomly disconnects your calls to 911 while some thug is beating you senseless because you couldn't hold the phone with one pinky up." is just a minor software bug?, I'm sorry, but the instant you say that the Telephone doesn't work, it gets demoted to iPod, it may be the greatest MP3 player in the world, and it certainly looks to be, but the iPhone has just been slayed, and it was by Apple and AT&T., not everyone in the world had an iphone 4 and not everyone in the world is able to be near wifi and over half of public wifi is password protected like 3G when it first came about Sprints 4G is young and last time i checked its just as big as at&t's 3g network currently and its growing and esp here on oahu, hawaii mostly everyone uses 4G for internet through "Clear" and u dont have to only use 4G to video chat there is 3G and wifi also u can use for the EVO aswell, i'd like to comment that my nexus one does a lot of things your ifone 4 cannot do ^___^ so it's more of a matter of preference than to state it like ifone 4 is the best fone ever., obviously if it is the best fone ever, there wouldn't be millions of us who prefer android., i'd like to see ifone do at least wifi portable hotspot and be open and customizable and widget capable before it can claim it's the best., it's way behind android in terms of features? -__-, <div class="idc-message" id="idc-comment-msg-div-84647304"><a class="idc-close" title="Click to Close Message" href="javascript: IDC.ui.close_message(84647304)"><span>Close Message</span> Comment posted., <p class="idc-nomargin"><a class="idc-share-facebook" onclick="IDC.ui.fb_wrapper(84647304)" href="javascript: void(null)" style="text-decoration: none;"><span class="idc-share-inner"><span>Share on Facebook</span></span> or <a href="javascript: IDC.ui.close_message(84647304)">Close MessageSo he thinks the iPhone 4 is better at the end of the day its what you think that will decide whether you buy android or iPhone theres no need to name call, leave that behavior at YouTube anyways., Hey MG great review stick to your guns man., "There are just so many things you can do on the device with such ease that are kind of a pain in the ass on Android" 
Like what?, iPhoneCrunch starring (M)ac(G)oober., Continuous articles like this really make me not want to read anything else you write., The overall state of your writing has really declined and it's sad to see that., I now have one more reason to skip them., I've already waited 3 years, so what is one more year?, But I am really tempted to follow Arrington's path of moving to a prepaid cell phone., Besides, who can afford iPhones and data plans for a family of 4?, Well, I can actually afford it, but why would I want to pay $280 a month for crappy cell phone coverage on AT&T just to have internet in my pocket?, Especially, when I already pay approximately $60 per month for Verizon FiOS internet., Perhaps, I am just starting to show my age ? 45., Or perhaps it's the fact that after 30+ years of having my hands on a keyboard and my face "glued" to a computer screen, that I am contemplating a life with less connections., I already ditched Facebook, Yammer, Twitter and personal use of IM outside of work, and I don't miss it one bit., Ditching the cell phone may be a more challenging "addiction" to conquer., I am not totally going off the grid though ? that would require shock therapy., Being a huge fan of apple-biased reviews of anything, I found this article quite enjoyable., Thank you so much for posting that picture of the screen comparison!!, How did I ever put up with that crappy-lookin' iPhone screen?, And I agree with you about the feels of phones: the brushed aluminum of the first gen iPhone was to die for., It was a treat for the fingers, for sure., :) ?however, I haven't yet held the iPhone 4 (some days I curse living in Canada!)
Thanks for the review!, wow, that is the most amazing explanation ever?., are u mocking us, or is that really the extent of your tech knowledge?, are u just trolling us so u can keep getting more comments?, i refuse to believe that a techcrunch blogger could be this uninformed about tech, it happens to be hilarious that as the iphone 4 is currently being released to a new consumate market you discuss the iphone 5., this review is just as pathetic and porked as democratically charged television., I thought this was a tech blog, not a blog for illiterate bimbos., WiMax on Sprint resolves the issue, if you want to switch to Android., Have you personally met anyone or experienced the antenna issue, as described, for yourself?, If the iPhone 4 would disconnect in the situation that you describe, so would any other cell phone on AT&T's network., If anything, the iPhone 4 is likely to maintain a connection when other cell phones on AT&T's network would not., For the evidence of this, see the authorities cited in my earlier post, supra., Let me know when you pull your head out of Steve Jobs' ass and only then may there may be hope of some objectivity or credibility in your product reviews., Until then, they carry absolutely no value., Here's his review: "So shiny, it's so shiny., It can't make calls?, But it's so shiny., Way shinier than EVO and way way shiner than Nexus One.", You actually don't see it at all., Both don't work only because of apple 
Google voice works on iPhone, they even had the app ready for official app store, but apple did not approve it 
As for facetime, so far, it is apple proprietary technology; and apple has not taken it to any other hardware than iPhone., They said something about open sourcing it, but that has not happened, and we don't even know what that actually means., One thing we do know though ? if a technology is available, someone will write an app for android., Facetime is simply not available right now to everyone., hmm, iPod touch is better and cheaper too., lol
though, did you ever figure that its the same signal for data and voice on 3G?, or your urge to defend has gone past this relaization?, Nice write up., Fuck the detractors., without that MG cannot make calls., His phone without that rubber is more or less iPod 4 which is more powerful than an iPad, Either NYT or you are mistaken EVO can do video calls over 3g., More over it is over 3rd party qik service., Apple Fanbois live in a cocoon and they refuse to come out of it even when they are wrong., Hey MG
you must understand that many people who bought Android based phones will hate you even if they agree with you., People hate when they spend some amount of money or made a long term commitment (two year of service) to something which is inferiour., It would be the same as you would come to a KMart with a Louis Vuitton bag and start telling to people that a Louis Vuitton bags are better than bags they buy in Kmart., I think we need more apple fans like you to reflect how great apple's products and philosophies are;  too many haters out there!!!, go hate on stuff that actually does suck?.!, Good grief ? so many ignorant haters!, The ignorance demonstrated by the haters is shocking., Notice that almost all had no counter? Just stupid one-liners that they read somewhere., Haters ? get a life, will you?, I wish I could tell myself that I really needed this phone., Too bad I can't., I have used Google Voice., WAY overrated., Transcription of VMs is mediocre at best., Voice quality not that good., I have N1 for 4 months., Never used Google voice., If it comes to iPhone 4, still wont use it, when will people understand that all service providers have inherent issues to deal with such as the geography (San Francisco one big cement hill) hello, RF is like light it travels line of sight., how many people switched to AT&T when the first Iphone came out?, Millions i am impressed that they were able to do as well as they did., Can you imagine how the iphone will impact the bandwidth of other carriers when the data usage increases 100 fold on their systems., as far as an antenna issue on the 4., if you move your hand it will not be an issue., wow that was easy!, the human body is very good at degrading RF., think about it these phones have a max transmit power of 600 milliwatts at 850,000,000 cycles per second (850 mhz) and 300 milliwatts @ 1,900,000,000 cycles per second., very little power at a ultra high frequency, and we expect it to transmit through our flesh?, stop your bitching we are all luck the crap work at all., maybe i should complain that my Kia Rio that has a 1500 cc engine won't maintain 80 mph up a hill., i agree with the ex-president., Here's what I expect to happen with Apple's software update:
1)  They will attempt to change perception of his wireless signal by rescale the signal results., This will shift the blame for the poor design away from Apple and to AT&T., 2) They will jack up the wireless signal strength., However, they have to be careful not to go outside of the permitted bounds set by the FCC and it would impact battery life., Of course, they could always blame the AT&T network for poor battery life too., You'll know that they did this if either people measure increased signal strength or Apple has changes to its FCC filings for the iPhone 4., Mine make calls just fine!, The iPhone is a very impressive device until the battery dies., My Blackberry is not a very impressive device until the battery dies., Look for a place to plug in., Pop in the spare battery., If both batteries die at the same time?, 60 seconds later, my blackberry is much, much, much more impressive than your hand held, glass and metal brick., You haters can hate on the iPhone all you want, but you still secretly covet it., Nice review!!!, I will just wait some feedback about the problem of "signal" before buying a new one :), I seriously don't understand why many of the commenters are hating on MG., The title clearly states that this is "An iPhone Lover's Take On The iPhone 4.", why do u find it necessary to reply?, Cause we don't really need to hear what a sycophant thinks., umm the ability to be on a phone call AND use the internet simultaneously makes the iPhone better than most of the androids out there running on CDMA networks rather than having google voice.., like really?!, you put more weight on something like google voice than simultaneous talk and web?!, he told you in the title that the review was coming from someone who loves the iphone., if you don't share his view, then why even read the article?, this isn't forced upon you., just read another article., my iPhone 4 doesn't have this issue? so it's the best phone out there :), wimax maps are a million times worse than ATT 3G, lol u might have like the first iphone then? we're talking about iphone 4? get with it, you must have the first iphone or 3g then.., we're talking about iphone 4 here? get with it., it does not suck., it might not be the "best" phone out there but it certainly does not suck., Best review I have read concerning the iPhone 4., He hit the nail right on the head multiple times., Coming from experience, Android is chock-full of features that are slow and a pain in the ass to use., Also, if the iPhone does in fact come to Verizon, that would free up A LOT**** of traffic on AT&T's network., If that is the outcome, I would stay on a GSM network simply for the ability to talk and use data simultaneously and to be able to remove the sim if necessary., The only reason I am not posting this on an iPhone 4 is because right now, I can't find one available for purchase., Call me a fanboy if you like, but simply jail breaking the iPhone can give it mobile hotspot features and the ability to run nintendo games on a gameboy-like interface., See, I am not totally under Steve's Nazi spell., everything- typing, accessing media, browsing the web, streaming video, running & downloading apps, organization, making it look tasteful, You can love the iPhone and give a reasonable review., MG can't., Gee ? simple spelling errors annoy me more than anything ? amatuer, as an all touchscreen phone, the resolution, accuracy, responsiveness and refresh rate of the screen are very important in my opinion., the iphone 4 is the best in all these areas compared to any android phone out there., try scrolling on an android phone and compare it to how the iphone (even the original) scrolls., it's seamless., the refresh is very high., it's not choppy like all androids which is trippy on your eyes., the resolution owns., iphone's touchscreen responsiveness is instantanous, making any lag virtual non-existent., (in regards to scrolling or dragging) 
and even though u said no talk about multitasking, sorry but iphone won this game., no need to exit what you're in and go to advanced task killer., double tap home, go to a running app or kill off running apps of your choice., specs wise, androids looks good on paper., but as a camera phone, does anyone ever use more than 5 MP really?, anything past 5 is for blowing up pictures, and I believe most people just end up posting them online, and hardly ever printing them out., removable micro SD card? cool, i give them that., you can store ANYTHING and transfer ANYTHING to any other computer., "my battery sucks I need a new one" *buys it and leaves store*., rather than going to apple and making them ship it out to get a new one., does this feature make android a better phone in terms of function?, it is convenient though if you did have a spare battery on hand., I wish apple devices got it., no thanks i'll jailbreak my iphone., weighing everything and looking at all pros and cons, in my opinion I think iPhone 4 comes out on top., So the advice is: buy a PHONE because it is such a nice DEVICE even if there is a serious problem with the PHONE's PHONE capabilities (worse, a harddesign flaw so not (easy) fixable)., Incredible advice, like buy a Toyota because it's such a nice car and don't worry about the breaks that can stop working from time to time., iPhone core business is being a phone like the name states with a lot of extra's and not an iDevice with a phone option, if thats what it is Apple should sell it like that., I like a lot of what you write MG but concerning Apple/iPhone you should take a step back because your view is certainly not objective., it's called jailbreaking., free mobile hotspot, tethering, and tricking your iphone into thinking it's on wifi to make facetime calls or high resolution youtube videos., thank you, you can jailbreak your iphone and get an app that tricks your iphone into thinking it's on wifi, I?m not an iphone user,nor an apple haters..also i?m not into iphone/android war.but seriously,this review really make me wanna puke..dude,get a life.lol
btw i?m using symbian powered nokia and it does what it supposed to :), advanced task killer is a pain., on the iphone just double tap the home button and kill off running apps of your choice or go into one rather., mentioning and discussing are 2 different things, mine too? no bars dropped when I hold the phone any which way., and I live in New England so I get great reception, your sour blackberry is shit for web browsing on that tiny ass screen., oh got a storm?, yeah have fun taking the time to highlight letters and then press down on the "click" screen., your blackberry died? holy f*ck it takes at least FIVE minutes to turn back on!??, "a new software update came out for blackberry and now all of a sudden my blackberry (in)conveniently is f*cking up" 
if anything blackberries are bricks., they are not pro-multimedia like androids and iphone., they're only good for emails which the iphone handles just fine., and it's got sh*t for apps., practice kegel's it might loosen you up a bit, The Evo camera saving bug was fixed the morning they launched the phone to the public? so it basically only affected the developers who got it early at the Google IO conference., I can't believe you even put that in the article, you'll try to discredit Android and any devices that use it as much as you can., This looks like a great post and I am interested to read it but it's just too long., Maybe you could consider including a summary (instead of just a conclusion) or highlighting the main points within the paragraphs., MG, you are absolutely right., I did hate this review., Techcrunch is sponsor by apple, All you Apple haters are pathetic, why do i have to listen to you fandroid when you never even own the iphone, your hate toward Apple making you fandroid look like an idiot., MG got all the phones that we can call smart phones out there right now, and he chooses the Iphone 4 to be the king of smart phone, then all you guys jump him., Unless you own all of those phone like MG, and find a job or create your own blog, then you can post your review there, then i will come and give you my 2 cents., If you dont have all of the above, just STFU, and listen to the man, MG., he knows what he talking about when he own all of those phones, Lot of comments remind me about console gamers., Where if something bad is said against their hardware then the person must be a fan of the other, damn sad., But anyways, the review lost its merit the moment you admitted to being a fanboi., That's what I meant by "There's a psychology to every major purchase and Apple blew it." Even if Apple fixes the issue, the iPhone4 is "tainted"., I'm just going to hold off until the iPhone5., Oh man you're friends are so lame, The multitasking of Iphone is a joke!, just because you own an iPhone doesn't make it any better.., there are equally good or better phones in market.., check out Samsung Galaxy S for a change.., I live in joplin missouri? no drop calls and this new iphone 4 sounds amazing., I can actually carry a convo in my jeep with the top off going 60 miles /hour.., so please reception issue depends on where u live? hasnt this been the same problem we have always had with AT&T?, Same here in the midwest? calls sound stellar too to be honest!!!, I asked about Verizon? What it has to do with Sprint?, BTW, I moved from Spring ? all due to their ripoff policies which they call "customer service"., So, having no data and voice at the same time I expect incoming voice call would kick you out of 3G Voip/Skype call on Verizon, right?, And in few months I hope we will see some voip app which can treat voip and OTA calls equally? move to verizon would be move in opposite direction., yes, at&t drops the call as crazy, but there is no good alternative, Time to resign your so-called "reviewer/blogger" position and go home, MG., MG is saying that he is delighted with the iPhone 4 notwithstanding any defect in its hardware that causes a degradation in its reception., I can speak more directly to that:  There is no defect in the iPhone 4's antenna system, and there is no problem with its reception that isn't present in any modern smartphone., See
  http://www.anandtech.com/show/3794/the-iphone-4-r  http://www.pcworld.com/article/200453/antenna_exp  http://blogs.consumerreports.org/electronics/2010? 
And for a demonstrate of the same degradation of reception to same extent, when a cell phone's antenna is close to or in direct contact with human skin, see:  http://www.edibleapple.com/signal-attenuation-is-?., So, there is no hardware defect in the iPhon 4, and there is no attenuation of the iPhone 4's reception of a signal that isn't common to all modern smartphones to the same extent., The problem is physics, not a defect in the iPhone 4's hardware, and the iPhone 4 handles the problem of attenuated reception caused by the close proximity of human skin as well as any smartphone and better than most., Tyler, you're an idiot, Funny how people complain about google voice not being on stock iPhones when it seems that half the Android devices that GV users are running it on are rooted themselves., In terms of coverage percentage and speed, Verizon is weak compared to some of the other carriers in the world., Never got why people hold V as a holy grail., What most people don't know about Android is there is no task killer needed., They actually are bad for the system., My Evo works way better since I stopped using one., Android was made to require no user interaction on multitasking, allowing the truly "smart" system take care of it behind the scenes., In reality, Android is even more intuitive than the iPhone, but most people don't see it., They want to control everything, and that's why they get crappy battery life, laggy interface and have to use a task killer., Also, Android's notification system owns., There is no competition there., Removable battery means you can buy a larger one, or you could get several, keep them all charged, and on a long trip, swap them out as they died., I just use externals though., Micro SDs are great, though I never really remove mine, it makes it easy to store and retrieve files., Adobe flash will be a plus once Froyo really gets moving., Mobile hotspot: You can have it legally without hacking for 20-30 but you could just get root, which is safer and sometimes easier than jailbreaking, and have it for free., Its called Wireless Tether., They even have AP mode now, so its a real hotspot., After using Android extensively since I got my hands on a G1 before last summer, and now using an Evo (had a hero too), and having used an iPod Touch 2G 8GB for over a year, I have to say Android is much nicer., I really see nothing worth going for on the iPhone., Android has everything I could ever need, why switch to something with more limits and 2nd rate tech?, The user has to manage the apps, rather than the system., about the same amount of time it takes to click "Use this backup" when you plug the iPhone into iTunes., There's tons of them., Look at every other TC writer who reviewed it., And as for the screen, the people not seeing the improvement would probably not be iPhone users., Having a pixel density better than what many print shops print at is always something rather nice., No, one of the pictures actually is of a black iPhone 4 with a white bumper, but I personally think the bumper makes it look like a cheap toy., Unfortunately, I think the bumper may be necessary for several reseasons one of which is the signal degradation., Not that I advise trying it with any phone, but I dropped my Palm Treo from waste high while standing on wood and tiles floors as well as concrete and asphalt many times and it caused no noticable damage beyond minor scratches on the corners, but I can't imagine the iPhone surviving this inevitable impact., Even if the frame survived the impact, I'd expect the glass to shatter or at a minimum to suffer from severe scratches  The Treo was a decent phone, but it was expensive and not what I would actually classify as a smart phone by today's standards., It must be $500-$600 USD., We've got freedom of choice too., The freedom of choice to either get an iPhone knowing it's a closed ecosystem (which becomes open if you want it to, thanks to the people who figure out all the JBs that the iPhone's had), or to buy into an open system., Both systems have advantages and disadvantages., You just buy based on what things matter to you., I'll guess that many of them are on Vimeo, which drops frames like hell., If anything, Android is way easier to do things on than my iPod touch ever was., Widgets let you change system settings with one or two taps., iPhone you have to go into the settings app and then change switches or dig deep into their horrific menus., Android's settings are really easy and straight forward to navigate., The only thing I can think of thats harder is killing a task, but I don't even do that because its bad on the Android system and I have seen force closes from the system occur due to task managers., Android manages everything for you if you let it., Let it work for about 2 or 3 days and it will optimize battery and learn when apps aren't needed, boosting performance., See, and that used not clicks, swipes, etc., Just use the phone and let it do everything for you., Chew on that Android haters., Actually, it's pretty nice., You should try it sometime., Also, it really is a joke on the 3G ? had enabled through a setting in the SpringBoard and the battery would die insanely quickly., Apple actually had a good reason to not have it, methinks., My Evo's screen has no problems, easily better than my old iPod Touch., Task killing isn't even necissary., Its a myth that you should use them and they will hurt the system after a while., Android needs no help with mutitasking., You use an app, switch to another, go back to home, do a quick search and then do some browsing., Come back to the first app, never come back to the second., Android handles it all., Then it shuts down tasks it doesn't think you'll be using anymore and frees up memory., I have no power issues and no lag using Android like it was designed., To jacrulez: Typing on an evo is way easier, thanks to an even bigger keyboard., Extra pixels do squat to help the keyboard., Accessing media is easy, its called a widget., Browsing the web, easy., Android browser has more features, but is just as easy to use as safari., Dolphin HD is like firefox for Android and offers the best browsing experience on a phone., Very close to desktop performance., Streaming video, again easy., Built into the system., If you don't like it, there's always more apps., And with flash you can stream even more video than the iPhone., Running apps: put them on your homescreen or search for them all in a drawer., Keep them in folders, organize them with organizer apps or alternate homescreens, downloading is easy., Search on the market, press install, accept the permissions it requires, and it downloads and installs., No different than the app store., You can use QR codes to easily find apps that you find on the internet., You could also download apps from other sources, but that is a little harder., Still, its something you can't even attempt on a normal iPhone., Lots of apps to help you., Like iPhoner's brag, there's an app for that., Making it look tasteful: Live wallpapers, normal wallpapers, themes, widgets., iPhone just got normal wallpapers, but it is still just row after row of apps., Anything I forgot?, I'm with you Tim??.I would like more details on all these things that are just so hard to accomplish on Android devices., Android is not inferior., I won't say the iPhone is necessarily inferior to Android, but it is in some ways., So far, I find few ways in which Android is inferior, and those few are always being patched up in updates, so pretty soon, Android will be the iPhone without the restrictions., Let me sum it up for all you know it all types., i am very happy about android based operating systems., the main reason is that you were not in line hammering my ability to get the New iphone 4., love it!!!, absolutely NO dropped calls., i live in longview washington and drove to Eastern oregon., around 250 miles i have at&t's Unlimited plan and talked to my wife the whole way., the battery was fine and i never dropped the call., BUY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT., I had a samsung Galaxy S what a freezing up piece of ______., But some people swear buy them> Great buy one ., I will stick with my iphone4., Can someone link me to where they will open source the technology?, I thought they were making it an open protocol, not open sourcing it., why do YOU find it necessary to reply?, Hey MG, what kind of case do you have on your iPhone 4 in those pictures?, Just wondering?I've been a huge fan of Incase iPhone cases ever since I got one for my 3GS a year ago., The problem is they haven't come out with one for the iPhone 4 yet and so I've had to be ultra careful with my phone (and will have to be probably for the next month until they release a case)., Would consider getting a non-Incase iPhone case if one that is on the market right now came highly recommended., system crashes were common before OS X., OS X is rock solid now for the past 10 years., If he did have OS Xm sounds like a failed component such as bad RAM., yes, sure
I have several android phones (Nexus One, Evo and Incredible) and I find Android to be inferiour with respect to t to iphone both in hardware and software., Which secret Android phone which is not inferiour do you  have?, Or might be a secret military innovation?, don't you think this is kinda late., Apple hasn?t ?innovated? in a long time., Its already behind the curve, and froyo + gingerbread are not even out yet., This next year will be brutal to the iphone., Nice write up MG., Maybe a video showing side by side comparisons would of been nice., That?s it., Apple don?t need a PR department with sites like this., Unfollowing on Twitter., You should call yourselves Applecrunch or something?, Who the hell uses KDE?, By the way it's open-source GPL., It's suppose to be developed on, with Apple being the most successful doing so., Most people don't have an iphone 4, yet still bash it., Stop standing around the empty watering hole; seek out areas with actual signal., Have you noticed only areas with a history of horrible signal quality are the only people having problems?, That fact says more about AT&Ts inability to make a network that can handle higher quality phones., Phones themselves don't all use the same frequencies, and the frequency the iPhone uses simply sucks on AT&T., I haven't experience this yet due to o2 in England being very awesome., My iPhone 4 reception is amazingly high., My death grip doesn't do anything to the phone., Therefore it's not a design fault by Apple., It's the network's inability to compete with a bleeding edge phone., It's like installing a Photoshop on a Eee-PC., It could be done, as shown, but honestly get a new 'network.', Please don?t feel the need to say goodbye, just leave., I am pretty sure we will all survive without your witty repertoire., Because it is wrong and stupid., 4 has more memory (256 to 512mb), faster processor than any other phone, better camera than any other phone, and Apple are the first to actually improve battery life, while HTC seem to be going the other way., Personally, 6 hours battery life for a phone is a joke, I like Apples approach., Haters going to hate, but why don?t you F off and hate somewhere else., I'm sure someone at Apple is working on an iDoll., Not tried the iPhone 4, but did move from the 3G to a Nexus One and it resulted in a huge improvement in usability, performance, and just general niceness., I'm sure the iPhone 4 is at least as fast as the Nexus, but I can't go back to Apple's way of controlling the user experience., The Nexus makes you feel free as a bird., Horses for courses though ? glad we have such different paradigms to satisfy both sides of the equation :)., Great review ? can't wait for iPhone 4 to hit Australian shores later this month, leo laporte is a hack., apple will face the same fate with android(google) as they did win windows(microsoft)., i don't understand why mr.jobs is allowing that, didn't he learned the lesson with microsoft?, Arrington you should fire this kid, his posts make me want to just unsubscribe., This was just fanboy garbage., apple always offered refunds., 30 days return policy has always been there., yeah, you can get android if you want shitty software and apps that may or may not work with your device., You conveniently forget several very bad things: 
1- The screen is very small., the HD2's 4.3" screen is **40%** bigger., What good are all those pixels If I can't even see them ?, Would you trade higher DPI on an 17" screen for lower DPI on a 22" on your desktop ?, To me, 4.3" vs 3.5" is the difference between usable and gimmicky., I can actually enjoy videos on my 4.3"? and scale those vids back to a lower resolution because its dpi is uselessly high already., I couldn't watch vids on a 3.5" (I tried, talk about stamp-size?) 
2- The thing is fragile., Yep, it's made of glass., If you've ever let your phone fall? well, an iPhone 4 would have broken., Don't dream of drag'n dropping files to it (and I do that several times a week), of installing anything Apple don't like? 
4- One-size fits all., the iPhone has gone from Haute Couture  to mass-produced bling, and makes a bad statement about its users., Pros use blackberrys, brains and rebels use Android, sheep use iPhone., This review is wide off the mark and very biased towards the US market., I speak as a gadget freak and UI designer., screen is TOO small, so no matter how sharp it is, it is a waste of technology., Go try an HTC Desire or Dell Streak and come back to iPhone 4., 2) The multitasking is a pain., On Android, all the apps appear in the centre of the screen on one panel, and are a breeze to select from., On iOS 4, you have to annoyingly scroll through a line of icons., 3) The rotation lock is limited to portrait view., 4) The camera has no physical shutter release, making photography very risky ? easy to drop the phone., 5) The camera may take photos as good as a Nokia N95 (3 years old) and the iPhone may have flat edges to rest it on, but there is no self timer!, 6) There is no USB port, so you're stuck with Apple's cables., 7) There is no way to wirelessly transfer files on and off iPhone 4., Truth is, along with the video, this review is embarrassing and despite over 20 years of loyalty to Apple, enough to force me to jump ship to the USS Android., Never thought I would write such a strong comment on TC, but the blinkered view of so many Apple users is hindering progress and lower prices., A true friend is one who will tell it like it is., Looking at the distribution of negative and positive ratings in this topic it seems that once your one trick pony routine gets a bit more jaded you and Mr Arrington are going to be having a chat possibly resulting you moving on to 'a new and exciting freelance opportunity'., The problem is, MG, even as an Apple user ? I'm typing this on a Macbook ? I don't trust your judgement and it seems I'm not alone here., It's OK to be a bit partisan but whilst retaining a healthy sense of scepticism but that just isn't you any more., Strange, I have never dropped a call due to antenna issues on any phone I have ever owned., My HTC desire is fine for calls and data no matter how I hold it, plus it gets connection in places where an iPhone is basically a brick., I can take my iTunes music with me by the way, I just don't get forced to have the stinking pile of horse manure that is the buggy and over bloated bit of software, iTunes itself., Now if I can just find a way to get the even worse pile of crap that is QuickTime to die a horrible death I will be very happy., What is really sad is to see a bunch of adults creaming themselves over a bit of tech., It is a phone not a woman, get a life for god sakes., Wait, what?, You're equating CDMA network limitations to the value of the entire Android platform?, I have a Nexus One., I could browse the internet while talking on the phone, but I never do., Who actually does?, hehehe good point !, Believe it or not, this was actually not obnoxious and pretty well thought out., I think the only beef with the other articles was many people didn't feel you flexed out thoughts enough and the blogs read more as a ramble., Can you comment on the availability of HSPA?, I knew the iPhone supported it, but i was under the impression that AT&T did not have it in most areas., Also, disclaimer' are fine, but "an iPhone Lover's review" is starting to sound redundant and slightly stupid., Change the theme slightly., Wow?.I am not sure what are you referring to., HTC EVO 4G has 512 MB RAM, 8MP camera., In terms of battery life, the iPhone 4 is not significantly better than iPhone 3GS., Droid X has much better specs., So get your facts correct, before ranting off?., The camera has amazing quality., The term Jobs used was "OPEN"., I don?t get it!, If you purchased a car or a computer and had all the problems your having and the manufacturer put out a statement that you could bring it back for a full refund!, why aren?t you running to the store for a refund??, Please explain to me why you guys continue to keep this sub standard equipment?, Notice that Apple said it will be a few weeks until the fix., That will put you over the 30 days for refund., Take it back and repurchase only after they prove its been fixed!, Once again, make them show you its fixed before you buy it again, or be stuck with this for a year or longer., Maybe if people do this it will show Apple that NO LONGER IS THIS ACCEPTABLE!, Oh wait your not holding it correctly., Steve Jobs is an assclown, and you guys that waited hours in line should be insulted by Mr., After that comment I would have gone back to the Apple store asking for a full refund plus 10% for tolerance!, I'm still waiting like many other to get the WiFi fixed on my Ipad, max range is about 20 feet., I have too tether to my phone just to get WiFi in my den., Steve also promised this would be fixed shortly!, Its been about three months., Antenna issues with ALL phones?, Get over yourself, I never had issues with ANY of my phones, poor iFoney users say that to feel better about it, has any other manufacturer said they will sell you a cover to make their phones give you a better signal?, I thought so., iFoney fans always mention someone they know who had problems with Android, because for sure, they would never try it or have to admit that they are better., "Figured it out immediately"?, That's because the iFoney is so simple and dumbing, it's your mum we talking about here!!, All mums need help with gadgets, unless they simple, what is there to figure out with the iFoney?, You can't change much on it., Or could she not even make a call on the Android?, "The app store is so massive"?, Yes, too large to find anything, and mostly useless., Maybe, but we don't need it to put music on any other phone, just bluetooth, drag over, or send by wifi, from any other phone or pc., Duh!, Why get tied down., Hmmm, my old Nokia? played music, (no iPod needed), had a 5mp camera(many years before iFoney did), made videos, oh, and it multi tasked and ran apps in the background too!!, NO other device needed for last few years there too!, It's really rather sad that you have not got out more, and discovered what's out there in the real world, not the little "Jobs' bubble" Nothing to do with not liking Apple, just some people are not mindless sheep, hypnotised into buying something that is so closed and limited., Get out and live Trent?, If you want to read a good review!, I don?t get it!, If you purchased a car or a computer and had all the problems your having and the manufacturer put out a statement that you could bring it back for a full refund!, why aren?t you running to the store for a refund??, Please explain to me why you guys continue to keep this sub standard equipment?, Notice that Apple said it will be a few weeks until the fix., That will put you over the 30 days for refund., Take it back and repurchase only after they prove its been fixed!, Once again, make them show you its fixed before you buy it again, or be stuck with this for a year or longer., Maybe if people do this it will show Apple that NO LONGER IS THIS ACCEPTABLE!, Oh wait your not holding it correctly., Steve Jobs is an assclown, and you guys that waited hours in line should be insulted by Mr., After that comment I would have gone back to the Apple store asking for a full refund plus 10% for tolerance!, Your statement of being biased is right on the money., I have a ton of friends with the iPhone and I laugh all day at the frustration with the network and lack of important customer friendly features., Facetime is awesome but why is it relegated it to wifi?, You can?t really multitask as you can with a Droid, apple freezes the app not let it play in the background., You can?t play the HD video on an HD screen as u can with a Droid x, thus why record it and then wrestle with it transferring it through a computer turn play it., Why doesn?t it have a removable memory so if you have a failure u can transfer he photos to another device., If it is so good why does it have a 25% failure rate?, You have to go with out a phone if you break it., Lastly apples walled garden for apps is a joke., Obviously you are so bought into fashion ur blind., Steve jobs is the pied piper and u will follow him off a cliff., If you talk about mobile devices you can't forget N900?, I thought you gave it a good review, and just because you are a fan and love the device doesn't discredit the review in my mind, too many haters out there that have to hate on something I guess., And haters don't check out our positive fanboy first impressions here, you won't like this either http://www.appezzy.com/iphone-4-first-impressions, article writers daughter is here now, we don't care what phone you have got, but you insist o telling us, so we hate on you?
all those words, and all you told us is that you have an iFoney? waste of time., must have been typed on his iFoney?, why would it have dropped calls on way home, you would not have been holding phone while driving, unless of course you are admitting to breaking the law!!!, stay away from Android, it's too much for you?, MG, you almost did it., You almost said something objective., ?From a technological and spec sheet perspective Android is impressive.? I almost feel like in your first draft you wrote ?surpasses the iPhone? (which on that scale it clearly does) instead of ?is impressive? but then changed it to keep your fanboy cred., iPhoners can cling to ?user experience,? ?simplicity,? and it ?just works? all they want but technologically Android is way beyond iOS., There is nothing an iPhone can do that an Android device can?t, but there is a literal laundry list of things Android does (or should I say allows) that iOS can?t., You don?t seem to know or care to learn much about the Android OS., Your comments on it reveal your limited experience with the platform., Educate yourself., There?s a reason it?s growing so rapidly and it?s not just Apple hate., Just read the Ars Technica review:
http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2010/06/iphone-4.ars
This is what?s called a thorough, well balanced review, featuring many examples, descriptions and where one can find both praises and complaints., The above post is just a joke compared to what they?re doing in Ars., Personally, I thought it was one of the most in-depth and best iPhone review I've seen., When he clearly stated that he was biased to Apple., After knowing that you posted anyway saying that he was biased., Hmmm? Interesting maybe he isn?t the one with the issue?., hold the phone at the bottom and watch the magic.., a company telling users how to hold a phone is pathetic by any standards.., http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvH-i7rKPJc 
My mom's Nokia gets 3bars/works great and my so magical iphone doesn't even get signal., In this case, apple really sucked so bad., Amazing review by arstechnica i must agree when compared to gizmodo,engadget and the shitty article by MG, I found the comments regarding the antennae interesting, as well as your note on the screen quality., I'll prolly get an Ipod Touch (1st gen) as a secondhand device as an upgrade from my 2nd gen Ipod Nano(hey it works just fine, im just looking to reduce the # of devices I have, its gotten to be a big mess with a cellphone, ipod, pda, a billion flash drives and memory cards, a nintendo DS, ETC., Uhh?I dunno, I think the earlier (decades) phones (cell) did have antennas on the outside :/, nice post MG., Features/specs are easy to compete on., iPhone wins hands down and against smartphones., Make it feel like every interaction and behavior of the device is being considered., Track how many "ooh nice, ( I like how they implemented this/that feature  | It's fun to interact with this thing)" "hey,( friends name) , look at how you can do this/that" "that's cool", etc., I would argue that the iPhone is not a smartphone., Apple is the defacto standard mobile computing device., While many would focus on bringing Apple down to the level of a smartphone by comparing features, specs, physical design., What "smartphone" competitors need to realize that the "gestalt" of the iPhone is building a better mobile user experience., The way it's perceived, looks, feels in your hands, the way applications work., A focus to create something that is "one"., People get it, when they use an Apple product., iPhone feels like one team in one company with laser like focus created it., Apple isn't perfect, but it seems like they are on a sustainable path because of the focus on the user experience of the products in creates., Competitors have the problem of piecing things together to "try" to feel like it's unified., The competitors are too fragmented to develop something as "complete" as the iPhone., Competitors just seem like they can't get it., Android, feels to clunky, too many different versions, etc., Judging by the anger of its fanboys, I?d say AndROID is aptly named., Get a grip ?, First, to make your Android phone a WiFi hotspot is not free., Second, it eats your battery alive., Third, you can do this on a jailbroken iPhone and not incur extra monthly fees., As for widgets I could care less., Give me ease of use and I'm happy like the majority of real people., All phones can have cracked and scratched screens, this isn't the year 3030., Now shooooo, run along now and go play outside with the other haters., I think the new screen looks worse, not better, even in your pictures., The colors are much brighter and more saturated on the older iPhone., I have seen them in person and still feel the same way., Perhaps it is Steve Jobs saying that it is better makes it so for some people., Just so you know- my cousin is a VP at Verizon and she said they are NEVER getting an iphone contract., MG tell us about iPad
I was traveling yesterday and 14 people on my plan had an ipad which they used during a flight
A guy had weird non-ipad tablet, it was black bulky ugly looking device which I failed to recognize., Tell us about ipad!, I am not buying an Apple iPhone 4., To tell you all the truth, I am myself buying an iPhone 4., Not because of any love for iPhone 4, but this is the best AT&T has to offer., Unfortunately, I have to be on AT&T as almost all my friends/family are on AT&T :(, All of these protocols are open already., This is just SIP/RTP etc and has been the de facto standard in VoIP for a decade., Apple is just going to be open about the way they use all of this., I'm actually not sure if they have a legal right to be closed about it., Insightful., I think even My IQ just dropped 70 points reading this "post", Are you thinking on people other than yourself?, There are many many other people put there like MG, who, as current iPhone users and lovers, can very much use a review from that point of view., When Saw VI comes out won?t it be useful to have a reviewer who liked Saw V review it from that perspective?, Pay attention to what I said and what David Pogue reviewed., Pogue reviewed the EVO's native app for video calling and found it to be terrible., Pogue did not review Fring, which is a third party app that you must download and install., Fring also, not surprisingly, has an iPhone/iPod Touch version of its video calling software., So if you want Fring for your iPhone/iPod Touch here it is:  http://www.fring.com/blog/?p=1616., So if you mean Fring, the iPhone also makes video call on 3G to any other device with Fring installed., If, however, you are referring to the EVO native video calling app, it, as Mr., Pogue described in his review, is so bad as to be unuseable, at least by the average user., Pogue was able, after two days and calling on a colleague with engineering chops, to get the EVO's native app working, but it worked very badly., I love that line up of all of the phones;  Is there a higher resolution version?, It's a great size comparison., The difference between the iPhone 4 and other phones is that the iPhone 4 loses (a great deal of) the signal when held *normally*., You have to jump through hoops to cause the signal to degrade on other phones., That is the important point here., Don't get me wrong, it saddens me to see this trouble on what would otherwise be a beautiful piece of design and engineering., But a defect is a defect, and a major one at that., I wish Apple a better luck with the next model., Actually I have a feeling that they can fix this issue with one of the next batches of the current model, but of course they cannot retract all the phones of the current batch as it will seriously harm them financially., Now it is up to you to live with that or not., if ur not on AT&T making phone calls is real easy ?.the call problem is the carrier not the phone?when iPhone comes to verizon what will u say than??, "get the iPhone 4., Are there antenna issues?, Yes, but they don?t adversely affect the overall experience" ? Isn't the fucki*g point of an Iphone to make calls?????!!!!!!!!!, you are being toooooo forgiving to Apple's lack of testing and releasing the freaking device so soon., Credit where due, reviewer owns more of the latest phones than anyone I know based on pic above., Gives him cred none of the haters can offer!, "Consider the sources" when forming an opinion, "misinformation in"  leads to misinformation out"!, Opinions are for followers, facts guide leaders!, The real question is does the attenuation of the iphone 4 happen at a position usually held by users., According to many, Steve Jobs in his introduction of the iphone 4 was himself holding it wrong., I don't care if other phones can experience the problem if I contort myself., The iphone 4 seems to display the problem held in a natural manner of usage., i was using a BT car kit., my point is i love the iphone and AT&T as well., it is almost like people think these devices should work like a land line., Gentlemen:  Take a look at my citation to edibleapple., com, supra, and you will see that both the Droid Incredible and the Nokia E71 are being held "normally."  And this will be true for most modern cell phones, that they will experience significant attenuation of reception when held at the bottom, because, for a conventional antenna design, the FCC pretty much mandates that the antenna be at the bottom of the phone to minimize the user's exposure to electromagnetic radiation from the antenna., Ummm apple has been playing catch up to google and android for the last 2 years, the HTC Incredible is a thousand times better than any iPhone, make that any HTC phone on an android platform 
I get that you love the iPhone but it is not the best phone out there at all, it was, but not now., Everything the iPhone has, Android has already had out for at least a year, also with Google you don't have to worry about a company giving you shit when you complain about their defect in the product, you just send it in., It's a phone, therefore it should be the best at making calls, not data first 
its the iPhone not iData, I stick with my Motorola Startac., I payed $2,212.99 for it back in the day and it still works fine for me., Anyone buying the load of BS Apple is putting out, please contact me so I can sell you a deed to the moon, I now have a clear understanding why Apple puts an "i" in front of everything., i stands for idiot
idiot phone
idiot pad
idiot touch
Now i understand ?., Thanks for sharing all the good informations about Apple iPhone 4 !, Love ur post., Dont regret ordering one just wish it would get here faster, steve jobs told him what to write!!!, I think the rapturous tone captures the experience., It?s really, really cool., The screen puts everything else I?ve seen to shame, it feels like a precision-built luxury item, the camera is a stunning leap forward? Sometimes you?ve just gotta hand it to them., Who let the trolls out?, Shouldn't you be under a bridge somewhere licking toads?, The main point that is always overlooked in iPhone reviews is ease of data transfer., Yes elegant styling is good, but the primary need I have is ease of data transfer., I just want to drag and drop, from anywhere, anytime., Surely the days of locked formats are well gone?, Having to use iTunes is such a hassle., Microsoft used to be considered the global bully, but they are now OS hero's compared to Apple., I find the blind acceptance of the control freak  attitude of Apple amusing., The iPhone is the only phone on the market that can't be taken out of the box and used straight away., It certainly does stand apart., let go of steve jobs nuts!!!, Well, maybe it`s really a shill`s review, but who could argue that iPhone 4 still does have some cool features?, This review doesn`t seem to be unfair, and the shots tell the truth anyway., Let`s not be so categorical., I liked the review whatsoever., galaxy s has powervr 540 (faster) vs the iphone4 powervr 535 (2X slower)
galaxy s has humming bird at 1ghz (exactly same as ipad/iphone4) (intrensity/samsung)
iphone has 960?640 res screen made by LG (how long till its in their phones or is surpassed by gingerbread much higher res speced screens) 
fire ya arguments away, but do it with facts, not bull., There are too many posts that are real suspicious: Clinton, Bush, and many that seem just rediculous., actually i forgot to say ipad uses 1ghz a4 but iphone prolly downclocked in the 700/800 mhz just for performance parity with ipad based on screen res differences, The hardware might be mostly high-quality, but the OS still sucks., It doesn't even have proper fully-capable pre-emptive multitasking yet; it's all done through APIs., Until the OS is improved drastically (or even replaced by something proper), the iPhone will always be limited, and will always need somebody to counter the bias and hype towards it in the tech media., Firstly, it's built into Froyo which has been released for the Nexus One., Secondly, of course, plug the thing in, just like the iPhone., Thirdly, this is against the iPhone ToS and why should you have to do something prohibited by the manufacturer just to get a simple feature?, There are Android phones with 768MB ? 1GB of RAM., Can you show me any official Apple specs that say the iPhone 4 has a CPU actually running at 1GHz?, The processor can achieve 1GHz but it's actually slower than the iPad which suggests they've underclocked it to get better battery life., The iPhone 4 is most likely a 800-900MHz phone., Prove me otherwise (with information from Apple, not a blog)., I found your web page from bing and it is superb., Thank for providing such an informative, oy it?s not about random browsing it?s about using the net as fits w/ the conversation, products are very sophisticated and charming., that's fantastic, Iphone 4? :-), with features that are available allows us to communicate with baik.ada interesting article on our blog please read on fact-about-komodo-dragon, It?ll be 0 once Windows Phone 7 is released., It is going to be adopted with all its problems., Its features are awesome and its also beautiful., So, Apple is going to rock?
  http://www.gadwad.com  http://www.gadwad.com/index.php/news/109-iphone-4?  http://www.gadwad.com/index.php/news/111-iphone-4?, Honestly, the antenna issues REALLY are that bad., It's been a real problem for me ever since I got the phone and I live in the middle of Dallas, Texas., I feel like I live in the back woods somewhere., The HD video function is the reason I haven't returned it though., Here's a sample: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67k5KuOe24g, I'll buy anything if it's shiny and made by apple., Of all said and done, there are lot many complains coming up regarding iOS4., I?m not sure, but there seems to be a problem with its loading speed., Also the downloading time is too long., There also seems to be a problem with the software., Users have been complaining a world against it and they are even considering shifting to some other smartphones., Wonder what?s going wrong !, Australia is (population wise) a tiny country., As of March 2010, there were over a million iPhone users down under., There's a reason why Nokia, Motorola et al are all going down the drain., Apple stuff works and works beautifully., The iPhone, be it 3g or 3Gs, is far from perfect, but it's closer than any other at this stage., I guess MG wasnt able to get net traffic over the last couple of days?.., here it is the most controversial post ever once again?., Calling himself a fanboy and then giving an Honest review what a joke., I remember Michael writing a post on the book "facebook effect"?., perhaps it is time he starts looking in his own backyard for sycophants, After all, True Love, ignores flaws, I personally feel that Apple should recall all these phones, give everyone their money back and re-issue them when they have fixed the design problem., MG, dont worry ? I care about this article, and i am sure lots of people care.., I love your articles, and I always wait for your next one? And I feel even this article gave lots of valuable input to me ? I tend to concur with most of your opinions., I think you should stop claiming yourself as "iphone lover" in iphone reviews, all these android fanboys will make your life hell unnecessarily and undeservedly!, You guys, as always, watch everything through the AT&T point of view., Check out ouside AT&T., I live in Romania, and I've never had a dropped call in any city., Very few phones had better signal than my Iphone 3G., It's the best PHONE I've used so far., I'm waiting for number 4., And, by the way, the cell company I'm signed with, is considered the worst in the reception issue in my country., Captain Kirk was the best ever!, No, he wasn't, Captain Picard was the best ever!, How about this title? A Fucker?s take on a Fucking Bitch !, Yes you can, McDonalds sell billions of burgers a year but they are still producing second rate crap., Amazed by this review., Truly a piece of apple fanaticism if I've ever seen one., Really, you're kidding me that it is really that critical to have a paragraph or two long literary orgasm about how great the iPhone feels in your hand?, Have you noticed, for instance, that the Nexus One and HTC Desire are almost exactly the same shape and size as the new iPhone?, Sure, the iPhone 4 is a lovely beast., But please try to be a little more honest about it's downsides if you want anyone to take a review even remotely seriously., Please learn the difference between "your" and "you're"., this guy never used NOKIA .., Yes, i have all rights to call you "FAN BOY" ., After few year,   the apple iphone 50 would be some freaky shaped and fast operating, stylish but NOKIA phones  by that time would be hardwired into ur brain., Even at that time, you would still be a great fanboy of apple saying "iphone 50  is the best phone i have ever used" ., All you Apple fanboys are just mediocre minded and happy with  a product that demands u to do stuff in its way., Its like u pay a lot for a hooker who never listens to what u want but does what she thinks is what u want, Still U r HAPPY ., Dude, this rig has issues.., and Apple's piss poor response about that "fix" makes me ill!, After several years of being an iPhone owner I'm seriously looking at returning it until they get it right (yeah, another story altogether)., No more iPhones!, At least until the iPhone 5 comes out., I really think we can all use a break after so many years of waiving through the *fantastic* iPhone articles., "Speculation aside, the iPhone 4 is the smartphone to beat from this point going forward., It will be fun to watch Android try to answer and see if they can dethrone the king before iPhone 5" wow they set the bar pretty low if this is the phone to beat?, there are already phones out there on par with iphone4 and the new offerings that are about to hit the market from samsung and motorola will make the iphone4 look like an also ran imho, MG siegler, once again you have embarressed yourself with another pathetic, biased and bs article., MG ,You are one sad puppy, you would purchase a turd if it had the Apple logo on it and then you would write another BS article claiming that the turd was the best thing ever., TIME TO SACK MG siegler., Sorry, but your pathetic journolism is bringing down the reputation of techcrunch and turning viewers away., Yes you might have the most replys but thats because the majority of them are people calling for you to lose your job., MG siegler = PATHETIC, I seem to have all my itunes music on my Android, and so does all the other people I know who use Android., My Android is faster than your iphone, and the hardware specs piss all over your already outdated icrap., Dont forget to ask uncle steve if your allowed to download that app, afterall, its still his phone., As for the great Apps on the iphone, I am assuming that your refering to your personall favourite, the one for curing erectile dysfunction ??, Judging by your pathetic post made even more painfull by your apple fanboyism I would say it hasn't worked, hence your need to start commenting on things you have absolutely no idea about, hoping it hides the deficiencies in your manhood, Have to agree with you 100%., I work in phone retail, in the UK, and get asked all the time what the best phone is., My reply has always been "it depends on you.", u have bed bugs, can see them around the mobile devices line, "I know Apple?s current stance is not to give these things away, but I wouldn?t be surprised if they don?t start doing it if the software update isn?t as effective as they hope." 
You're effectively saying "I know Apple's current stance is not to give bumpers away, but I would be surprised if they started giving them away if the software update isn't as effective as they hope" ., please sack this guy, this isnt what techcrunch is about?, you should have added a paragraph just for battery life? can it last one day (7am ? 9pm at least)?, You should be embarrassed at your failure to correctly spell embarrassed., Time to give up your commenting rights, kid, until you improve your spelling 
There's a reason MG is one of the most interesting journalists / bloggers on the net, and you're not, Who is making the rules now, Dave?, Hey guys whats the problem with this article, in the first paragraph it well written what kind of review it is, an apple enthusiast review., So whats the problem to love something ?, Do you think that Apple users go on Nokia's, Htc's and others reviews and blame the author of the review., No, I don't think so., If you have so much hate, go and use it against big corporations that really do bad things to us and not some stupid gadgets, phones or whatever it is., We are not alone on this planet so learn how to respect others opinions., Remember this:
I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it., So think a little more before you write your comments, and btw I use a Nokia E90 so no Apple fanboy here, but if the antenna problem goes away I will change my phone., I think you might like anything that Apple puts out., It's like a placebo., I have used both Android and iphones and I like them both, although the apple OS is definitely easy to use for a beginner., The iphone has been having some trouble lately with the reception issue and now the problem with the amount of bars showing up., I am waiting to see what the Motorola Droid X turns out to be, seems like it might be a little too large, time will tell?, MG said iphone 4 is the best smartphone right now out there., What wrong did he say?, I read around 10 different reviews of the iphone 4, and all have the same conclusion!, I like MG's reviews because they are the most down-to-earth and talk about things you and me would practically think about (ex., It almost feels like your friend is talking about these things to you? and this is definitely the approach I would like to here., MG siegler is definitely the guy from the EVO vs iphone cartoon " I dont care " 
If someone is going to do a review and compare it to the competitions products, you need to have objective reasoning, but unfortunately, MG's HATRED for all things ANDROID and his blinded fanboy lust for anything Apple makes his reviews laughable, pointless and subject to critisism., The iphone cant make calls MG " I dont care " Says it all really., Nice review MG, I currently have the 3GS and a year left to run on my contract (02 in the UK) so I'll hang on until iPhone 5., If I could afford it though ? I'd be all over iPhone 4., apprently, I think its for both?
if there's NO data whatsoever, it would be phone's before iPhone? get it?, if it EVER comes? and btw, I think it might be a long time till the iPhone actually comes on Verizon!.., considering Steve jobs doesn't like CDMA? coz to be honest, its a pretty old technology., Verizon has dead spots too? fortunately, I live in a area where almost every network has excellent coverage? i.e., <div class="idc-message" id="idc-comment-msg-div-85029086"><a class="idc-close" title="Click to Close Message" href="javascript: IDC.ui.close_message(85029086)"><span>Close Message</span> Comment posted., <p class="idc-nomargin"><a class="idc-share-facebook" onclick="IDC.ui.fb_wrapper(85029086)" href="javascript: void(null)" style="text-decoration: none;"><span class="idc-share-inner"><span>Share on Facebook</span></span> or <a href="javascript: IDC.ui.close_message(85029086)">Close MessageActually, the signal issue's have little to do with actual dropped calls., Regardless of the indicated bars on the screen (which are inaccurate in the first place), any phone can still drop a call even with a full signal if the tower they're connected to doesn't have enough bandwidth to continue or place a call., One of AT&T's biggest issues is the overall amount of data it can handle on a per tower basis when too many people with high data consuming devices are on the same tower., Meanwhile, if the iPhone 4 is reporting higher signal then is available then of course the call placed is not going to go through as you're actually in a low signal area., With that said, there are more faults and limitations with the carrier more so then actual issues with the iPhone itself., I still consider the fact that the iPhone 4 could have avoided all of this by simply putting a non-conductive finish on the exterior antenna, but overall this iPhone gets better service then any phone I've ever used, Android included., Well if we cut out the phone then its an ipod touch 
a phone is a phone first, then a data center and all that jazz, if you want your phone to be shitty, because the data is all that matters that's fine but I guess I'm the only one who uses the phone portion of an IPHONE., not to mention how bad the phone portion functions on AT&T half the time it is an iPod touch, bloomberg just confirmed via a Verizon employee that the iPhone will ship in January, Lmaol most biased review ever., U can make the bars drop in other devices such as iphone 3gs yes is an apple faulty antennas try other companies i cant with my evo or palm pre kr blackberry tour., Didnt this lame ass website said the evo had horrible battery life?, My batterry last all day after heavy surfing txting and talking also with a live wallpaper installed., I mean you guys are on apples dick to much i wonder if u guys get paid by apple since u are recomending apple iphones whats uou guys commison?, You've never witnessed antenna issues with any of your phones, what is actually taking place the entire time is a completely different story., When you're driving while talking on any mobile phone for example you are jumping cell towers left and right., You're constantly moving in and out of line-of-sight with whatever tower you're nearest too., Meanwhile, other factors such as what your car is made of, your own physical body, and anything else that gets in between the phone and the tower can cause signal degeneration., Lastly, you're counting on each tower to have the available bandwidth to continue your call, another factor you can't really control., The fact your phone doesn't show these fluctuations in the form of little tiny signal bars on your screen is so that you don't freak out and think you're phone is constantly losing signal which in reality it is constantly experiencing significant fluctuations., Just as your phone doesn't display these constant signal fluctuations, if you hold any phone blocking its antenna it will cause siginal degeneration but just like when you're jump a cell tower the phone's software doesn't report this to the user as it as seen as a temporary fluctuation., If you hold the phone in that position long enough you will eventually see the bars go down depending on how sensitive the software on the device is., The iPhone 4 software is flawed in that it is showing more signal then it should be showing then when you cup it with your hand presenting minor signal degeneration it swings the other way and shows less signal then there really is., The phone is over compensating, then under compensating and is sadly displaying this information to the user in real time in the form of little bars on a screen., What any of this actually means is rather insignificant to placing your call, or maintaining it if you in a good signal area., All mobile phones have antenna issues, as does any other mobile device., The laws of psychics still apply to mobile phone, and because of this all mobile technology is essentially flawed., I think the idea is that when/if the iPhone launches on Verizon it will come with an LTE 4G radio, allowing  voice calls via CDMA and data usage via LTE simultaneously., Jeez man you?ve really drunk the apple coolaid!, Dude the backflip beats the crap out of the iphone anyday, and explain exactly why you say CDMA is old?, I am a microwave engineer with a PhD  ? sorry to break it to you nand ? but CDMA uses spectrum much more effectively than GSM ? which is why you'll notice CDMA calls in overly loaded areas dont suffer from S/N degradation., Would help if you don't espouse things about which you know absolutely nothing about:), Fucking A, about 8 phones on the market have a better camera., That's not even real multitasking., The OS looks dated and the phone itself is actually uncomfortable to hold., After playing with one for a few hours, and after hearing all the hype, I was less than impressed., Actually, this past weekend half my buddies with phones actually preferred the feel and look (Android) of the Nexus One., So?you buying that iPhone 4 right now?, well, no one has shown me this $ 300 price tag., A normal iphone with AT&T contract makes a total of $3000, and an unlocked iphone is around $1100 ., MG said iphone 4 is the best smartphone right now out there., What wrong did he say?, I read around 10 different reviews of the iphone 4, and all have the same conclusion!, Lmaol so if it was based in terms of data then evo is the clear winner better 3g reception with the addition of 4g with a bigger screen to see web pages., Dont give me the bullshit retona display excuse to normal human eyes both screens look nic., Who the hell puts the screen up in their eyes to be able to tell the difference., Yup, these guys are right., The iPhone 4 seems to have better reception than my 3GS did., There were dead spots that I hit every day on the way to work with the 3GS, and now they are not dead spots., Battery life is better than my 3GS, which is a welcome trend that is the opposite of so many other phones., It's just not as bad a phone as you may believe., It's not like users of Android devices that use GV root their phone to use GV? especially considering it comes preloaded on newer versions of the OS?., Your comment does not make any sense., Sounds like a troll comment to me., I'm a huge Android 'fanboy', but cmon, the backflip beats the iphone?, I don't think the issue at hand is that he said it was the best smartphone right now., Plenty of people would agree with that (though, not me)., I think it has more to do with this was a largely uninformative post titled a "review"., If this was "My biased opinions on my I-Phone 4" and wasn't on techcrunch I don't think there would of been an issue., This post simply shouldn't be titled as it is, and shouldn't be a techcrunch article., Blaming the carrier for the failings of the phone is getting to be all consuming., Apple seem to be using it as a get out clause for their own phones poor record., I wonder if the reason that the iPhone is only available on one network in the US is they like having a convenient scapegoat., I use my HTC Desire on exactly the same network as many of my friends who have the iPhone 3Gs., I get far better connectivity than my friends in exactly the same place, and in 3 months have never dropped a call, whilst my friends drop 2-3 calls a week., I have only seen 1 iPhone  4 out in the wild so far and as that is on a different network to me I really can't compare it to my phone properly., Are you his boyfriend or his mother ?, MG is NOT a journalist, he is a blogger at best., When it comes to the iPhone, anything MG writes is not a review but a sales pitch., That's what annoys so many people., Half the people who comment on this site are asking for him to leave for the benefit of techcrunch., When I read a review, I want an honest review NOT a sales pitch, if MG wants to work for Apple, why doesn't he ??, I have got a feeling its because he just isn't good enough., Am I embarrassed about my spelling ?, No, But I am for you, after all, most people who comment on other peoples grammer and spelling are the ones with nothing better to do and classed as being anal, does that seem familiar to you ?, MG,
I have had my issues with reviews in the past but this one is good for the fact you don?t call it like it isn?t., Omgwtf2, you?re so well named., If you don?t want a cell phone get an iPod touch?well under your requirement ($300)., If you want a smartphone then you?re going to pay for service (or else why bother with the cell phone) which is going to run $70/month minimum., Do the math., I rank smartphones and the iPhone 4 remains the highest rated:  http://brianshall.com/smartphone/210, Best reply in this thread., This opnion piece is *really* glossy, like glossing over the competition?s features with a statement like ?There are just so many things you can do on the device with such ease that are kind of a pain in the ass on Android.? Tight integration with Gmail?, My favorite Android feature: On-the-fly web stylesheet rewrite in the browser., I own an iPad and I?m tired of resizing pages manually on it., This is the best review I have ever seen on any product., I normally go to youtube so I can see it myself, but you covered most of my questions here., "I decided to try something out., I did the same thing with the iPhone 3GS ? and guess what?, Same results., Granted, it is much hard to push the connection to this point of failure on that device, but it can be done (by wrapping your hand around the entire bottom of the phone, where the antenna resides)., Interestingly enough though, when I would do this on the iPhone 3GS, the signal would degrade, but the bars wouldn?t fall., Perhaps this is why no one noticed this issue on the iPhone 3GS but they are noticing it now?" 
EXCUSE ME??, That's NOT the same result., The 3GS has to be completely cupped at the bottom to degrade the signal, whereas the iPhone 4 merely has to be touched to completely KILL the signal., A small point in the iPhone versus Android wars: if you are a Hotmail user (and yes there are millions of us), the iPhone has a great hotmail app ? mBox ? while on Android you are stuck with the hotmail website or using POP3, which stinks., If someone would make a great hotmail app for Android, I'd switch., actually, now that apple switched to 256kbps DRM-free music, you now can carry it with you on any device (that can play the format, which i know android and blackberry can at least) :)
amazon mp3 is cheaper though, but same quality., i would maybe use amazon mp3 if it had a good software, but it has none and i don't like downloading mp3 files over my browser into a folder as my music library ;), Presumably when you say "if I actually needed a phone" you aren't talking about using it for phone-like things like making calls or getting data service., Well, at least I assume you don't care about those things because you said you would buy an iPhone., Alternatively, maybe you didn't know about these faults because you read uninformed doublethink posts like this., The comments about the web surfing being faster are true but they are due to the processor., Speed tests show that the wifi on the 4 is significantly slower than the 3GS., And that pisses me off, Reading Android Fanboy posts are enough for me to buy my first iPhone., Those kids are pathetic, wow., Boats n hoes photo?, thanks prestige worldwide?., "In my view, iPhone 4 is the biggest leap forward that any iPhone has taken yet over the previous generation., (?) The form factor is much better." 
How the hell is the form factor better?, It's the same form factor!, Then you go on and say it's much faster., In reality is just fast ebough, the previous ones were too slow and underpowered, which made them almost unusable, especially 3G with iOS 4., The iPhone is the best and that's the bottom line., Screw all the google dolls and micro brains out there., Keep hating fools with your iphone knockoffs and wannabes., Apple has the style and the tech., This all comes together so well that all the me-to googley phones look like sci fi trash now., Apple changed the game again in two ways., First, with easy to utilize cell phone/pda/gaming device UI and tech., Then suddenly whilst all the google dolls and micro brain phone where trying to out sci fi the first three iphones, Apple went classic retro design on those two clowns., Keep shaking and baking on those haters Apple., Mrs Jobs, keep making them hate., You gotta love it., It won't be long before they copy Apples backgrounding Tech., Watch and see., id "idot" intentional, or are you merely so taken with your own raging wit that you can't be bothered to type out all those annoying little letters?, you give this cell PHONE your highest rating yet gloss over the major antenna problem., Only Apple could find a way to drop more calls on the nations worst network for dropping calls., Yet apparently in your mind a cell PHONE does not have to make calls to be a good phone.., just look shiny and pretty., I thought the primary function of a phone was to make calls.., too bad you have no objectivity at all.., just a biased apple fanboy spewing the typical fanboy crap?., Great review? Odd that it's met with bitter, sarcastic and uninformed negativity., There are some maladjusted people posting on the web these days, I guess., Sorry this discussion loses its usefulness/validity after the first 3 or 4 one-liners., Oh Steve you have been tortured by by reading this? With hyperbole as your only defense!, Just claw your eyes out to stop the pain Steve., Sean, you must have been too busy formulating this simpleton response to actually read the whole article., He discussed the antenna at length., And came to the same conclusion as have every iPhone4 owner I've spoken with: Whatever the design, the call quality has improved with fewer dropped calls and zero noticeable signal degradation under normal usage conditions., One other note, Sean, you might get with the times and learn that these devices are truly computers and for many the phone function is a side note to a rich Internet experience., Your ignorance and bile as dully presented render you an anonymous tool most guilty of the name-calling you spew under the cowardice of anonymity., Apple should pay you to market the iPhone., Youre doing a much better job than the new lame assed Apple commercials., I dont use Android nor the iPhone as the former is too fragmented and the latter is too locked-in., I am putting my bets on WebOS., Since HP's purchase of Palm, I can guarantee if HP is going to put WebOS in all of their devices(printers, etc) then they will have a high level of integration with Windows., Since Windows still garners over 90% of the desktop market and there are far, far many more applications available for Windows, I think WebOS will become the linux that MS has been looking for: one that will not take market share from Windows but compliment it like WinMo never really did., Yes, I will admit that the hardware that Palm chose to run WebOS was ill advised, but none of the other competitors UI even compare., I cant stand to use an iPhone for more than 2 seconds since Ive tried WebOS., I know I will get flamed by all of the fanbois and fandroids, but I would safely bet that if you were actually USE WebOS objectively for more than a couple minutes you would come to the same conclusion., If there's something better I use it, just as the author stated so subjectively., All I have to say really is, dude? seriously, your account name says it all., BTW, fanboy is considered a derogatory term, not an endearing one., It's loses you credibility right out of the gates., I blame Apple for not allowing me to decide what applications I would like to use on "my" phone., Google allows it for Android, Palm allows it for WebOS, Nokia allows it for Meego and Symbian, and on and on., In fact, Apple is the only major player to lock users into every aspect of the phone., From what software you can use to transfer files to your computer to the carrier to the apps that I can buy., That doesn't sound very enticing to say the least., Also the lack of multitasking for 4 generations in the most hype smartphone on the planet is simply inexcusable., If Apple engineers are so bright why did it take them so long to implement one of the oldest concepts in computing., Multitasking has been around in some form or another since before UNIX way back in the 70s., Apple clearly doesn't care for their customers opinions, if so any number of issues could have been addressed so far and yet not one really has been; for example, Apple could easily allow other carriers in the US to use the iPhone and that would immediately help alleviate concerns about the iPhone's signal quality because we would have something to compare AT&T to., America's free market system operates around freedom of choice and Apple seems hell-bent on taking that choice away from you, but it's your choice to comply So if you want one man to dictate how you are allowed to digitally interact with the world just so you can hold a shiny, fruit-labeled brick, don't be surprised or offended when you lose something your feeble mind actually does care about., my wife has the EVO, but I'm a long time Blackberry "old School" kinda guy., The Storm is enuff for me right now, If Iphone 4 or 5 comes to Verizon then I will consider., VOICE+Data quality is very important to me., I have had Blackberry pick up voice on the same network where other phones could not!!!, At the end of the day, IF you cant reach me then pixels and facetime and HD is useless., I always read that you can "just jailbreak" your iPhone so you can do what YOU want., Why then feverishly support the one company that explicitly denies you to do what YOU want?, Fanbois apparently don't value their freedom of choice, you realise that Apple considers this an actual crime don't you?, Plus you have to re-jailbreak that bitch every time you want that iOS update., Kinda defeats the purpose of getting what you want to begin with., Personally, I haven't had connection issues with my iPhone from holding the phone, but I bought a bumper when I got my phone so that I could protect it until better cases were released., As someone else stated, it is the really is the carrier that is the problem., My reception has always been spotty in many areas, even before I bought this phone 2 weeks ago., When I first moved into my house, we did not get reception when standing inside., Gradually it got better, but 3 months ago it got worse again? oh well., My roommate, who does not have the iPhone but has AT&T has the exact same issues, so I am not worried., I only keep AT&T because most of my friends and family have it, so I am able to chat with them for free and keep a low cell phone plan., He makes a point in the article when he states that wrapping your hand completely around the antenna on any phone will affect signal strength., I happen to appreciate the article, though it has its flaws., I'm glad to hear that you feel the antenna problem doesn't affect the overall experience of the iPhone 4., Makes me look forward all the more to when I get that magical call from AT&T telling me my preordered phone is FINALLY here., It's amazing how many people will pay for terrible ATT service because of a toy., The phone is a fancy toy wrapped around a phone the phone part which should work well but is actually marginal because of carrier (and maybe design) issues., People become hooked to the toy like crack and just somehow can't live without ? the toy fun>annoyance of poor reception., Only one conclusion: Apple is brilliant., Only one real question: Why no other carriers yet?, ATT was the only carrier that would give in to the crazy demands of Steve ? reasonably priced unlimited data plans (no you can't charge them by the megabyte) and good usable phone software (yes?you do have to lose the sucky carrier software like Vcast and other carrier garbage bull pricing schemes) in favor of Apple's in-house or 3rd party-approved and clearly much better software., Since ATT sucked so bad they would do anything to get more customers ? they gave Steve his demands and he made them the carrier and the gamble paid., As for Steve, he'll continue laughing all the way to the bank., And, truth be told, he deserves it., I wonder how much Apple pay u for the article?????, I need a phone to make a call and get call back So
Why do I have to pay for the data monthly when I buy the iphone and I don't want to waste money to get the iphone so people ( Stupid people ) think ???S???T???P !!!!!!!!!, you're: learn about it, It sounds like the "antenna problem" is only a problem for those who don't own the phone., gosh, you buy right into apple's propaganda., Why is it you're willing to spend $$$ on an iphone 4, but skimp when it comes to beer?, Seriously dude?Budweiser and Coors?!?, Vadim, 
You are pretty ignorant., Using Google Voice, you may make calls through the 3g data connection at the same time and utilize any app you want., So once again, an ignorant and close minded Apple user doesn't understand everything., The Iphones have been great phones., Android is really kicking their a-ses as of late., By the way, Google Voice rocks., Conversion of text messages from voice mails?  Apple can't do that for free., Just read up?

It is fine to like your phone., I don't, my droid is still more useful in almost all it can do, including true multitasking., And it has a significantly slower processor than the Iphone 4., Android makes me sick., Not to friendly at all., The iPhone is more than features., It is "Social"., Apple got it rite when they created a phone that not only a geek could use but the clueless could use to and that makes them all connected!!, I had a Droid for 7 months and have had every iphone made., You android folks have to be kidding me?, Laggy screen, applications that look they were made for an atari 2600!, lol ? The FB app is laughable at best when compared to the iphones., So yeah I am a fanboy, Get over it!, Android is inferior!, Yes, I know, only they are the most ridiculous things to use and the quality of the calls are so bad it's not worth it., ? No basis in fact whatsoever, you've clearly never used it., Seeing as you had an EVO (doubtful),
just tell me what program you used to do it., Hurry, go google one and pretend you tried it., I love how people make assertions and use irrational and emotional arguments, like lemmings following the Apple herd., The camera is better on iPhone 4, no doubt and quality of the case might be better., What else would you say is higher quality?, The non customizable ui?, Another thing people seem to say is the screen is better., Ridiculous statement since the technology it uses requires more power and the PPI is higher than the naked eye can see., I bet you feel a real sense of accomplishment when you look down at the screen knowing that it has a big number behind it you can't see., OS X is only rock solid if you only use the apps that's included with the os itself, once you get outside of that box you're in for a world of hurt., Truth behind that is probably not the os but rather the fact that more people develop  for PC ( probably on the order of 20 times more) and by the simple act of competition you get better products on it,  however you can also get the crap that comes with it., The people who complain about PC and say something is better on Mac are usually the problem themselves., It's easy to not crash when you support a very limited scope of hardware and have very little selection of applications., " Oh but you can run windows on a mac" , then what's the point?!, To pay twice as much?, You believe the hardware is better?, The hardware is practically the same., The only difference is you're paying 500-1000 extra for a white case with an apple on it., I'm baffled that there can be articles that start their first paragraph with saying they're biased then go on to do a review as if there would be a point., I'm no Apple fanboy, the iPhone 4 is the only Apple device I have in my home, and I agree with the author? this is a great device when I compare with all the other previous phones I had (HTC, Nokia, etc.)., It's really a  leap forward?., to be able to talk with family with facetime is amazing, and the videos of my 2 yo son are just incredible (my wife couldn't tell if I had used our video camera)., Another thing, I've been using the device extensively for a couple of weeks now, and even during a road trip., I seem not to be able to replicate the antenna issue, and I have not had one dropped call so far., In fact this phone seems better than my previous iPhone 3GS., So, I wonder if this affects just some units or you need to be in a very specific radio coverage situation., Two months ago I would have written this review off as the rantings of an Apple fanboy., I've never really been an Apple enthusiast, but a month ago I was given a new iPod Touch., I now get the enthusiasm for the iPhone., Granted the iTouch is not the iPhone, but it is the same basic interface., After years of cursing my Windows Mobile devices, the i-interface that Apple has is amazing., Now, if only I lived in an area that AT&T serviced, I'd go right out and get an iPhone, even if I had to carry a cheap alternative cell phone to make up for bad connections., And in regard to bad connections and the possibility of Verizon carrying an iPhone, here's a couple of thoughts? I've heard from an inside Apple source that Verizon will never get the iPhone., But even if they do, will it solve the connection issues?, I've also heard that the problem is only partially the result of AT&T service, and partially the result of the iPhone just being a bad phone ? a great device but a bad phone., Greatest review I have read for a very long time., As a 3GS user, I can attest that the antenna issue has been around since the phone came out., Holding the 3GS in your palm (which is the natural hold after all) will result in 2-3 bars falling off, and in any area with less than 5 bars the phone will lose service., Perhaps that is why so many iPHone users trash the ATT network., My old flip phone will make calls where my iPhone will not., The iPhone is a really great platform for apps, and was groundbreaking in many ways., But as a PHONE it is a step backward., This phone was obsolete weeks before it was even released., Have fun dropping calls, 100kb upload/1MB download for the next 2+ years while AT&T tries to upgrade their network and Apple gets the next outdated phone ready., too long didn't read., I agree with your conclusions., Don't you know that Android kicks Apples ass now?, Sure the iPhone was the best thing out for the past couple of years but they aren't top shit anymore., I had a iPhone but once I got my hands on a Nexus One I immediately knew the iPhone lost the game., Sorry but you need to wipe the cum off your phone and admit the best devices are now Android., If you don't see that then you are blind., Do I like the iPhone 4?, Yeah, one can argue that., I'm going to wait for the Verizon Deal to come around, or just wait out my contract., I may be a fanboy, but I don't have the money to waste every single time the new version comes about., Now definitely my thought is true, that iPhone is for nowise user and Android for Professionals, after reading this crap :), If that's a pic of you and/or your friends, well, it, uh, undermind your 'argument'., recessions and depressions make you appreciate crumbs of bread ? OK maybe not crumbs, but in a situation like the great depression, every penny counts., When you're really, really hungry, a slice of bread or a bowl of rice can end up being the best meal you ever ate., We are in a recession, Apple is in some ways the only real game in town., Things can be better than this., But when that bowl of rice is all you've got, it's the best in the world., Tut, tut, sour grapes Mark??Must be tough working for all you guys working at Google, or wherever., Maybe you're just a ShillMarkAndroidFanBoy., FYI:  I haven't bought in to either, yet, but checking out my colleagues' phones in simultaneous challenges, the 4 slaps them all down UFC style?..nothing compares., I, for one, found this review SPOT ON? shill or no shill., I just have to get out of T-Mobile and on to AT&T., I don't know anyone who doesn't hate AT&T, and their lies about coverage., I'm in a dead zone with no AT&T coverage where they claim full 3G and Best Coverage., AT&T holes are everywhere, dropped calls are the norm, and everyone knows it., You must work for them, or make money out of them somehow., You stated: "If I 100% knew that was the case, there is no way I would recommend anyone to buy the iPhone 4 right now., But, just as was the case  last year, I simply don?t know that right now ? and I?m not sure anyone besides Apple really does (including both AT&T and Verizon)., Basically, buying the iPhone 4 right now is a several hundred dollar bet that it won?t launch on Verizon in 6 months., It?s a gamble." 
? but what if the I Phone 4 can be UNLOCKED/Jailbroken to work on Verizon?, I think that it would be a bit presumptuous (and certainly juvenile) to go after MG personally, since I don't know him nor have I ever met him., However, that being said, this article is complete and utter fanboy tripe!, I would much rather hear an objective, independent take on the new iPhone as opposed to this blatantly biased, one-sided garbage., I certainly hope that MG doesn't make any false-claims as to being a "reporter" of any sort., Just as a disclosure: I own and Android phone (HTC Hero) as well as an iPhone 3GS, both of which I like equally., Good review, until bad spelling made me stop reading., If you don't know the difference between "your" and "you're," I'm not going to give your product review any credence, and I'm not going to waste my time., "Once the initial cool factor wears off, it?s like your in the room with them.", You can buy an iPhone for $599 without a new contract read the fine print., Nice review, but DUDE, it's "you're" not "your", and "faze" not "phase"!!!, Sorry to nitpick, but hey, you're the one who is a professional blogger read by thousands, not me., Mistakes like these do not add to your credibility., Ian man, I dont care about your spelling but I thought your comments were funny, especially the part about the turd with an apple logo., Honestly, I hope Verizon doesn't get the Iphone., The truth of the matter is that most people buying the iphone are buying the phone and not the service., They are willing to sacrifice poor service(I had At&t for 5 years) for the "cool" phone., Well I personally am happy with the comparable droid phones on Verizon, might not have the apple logo, but are good enough and my call quality is top tier and not bottom of the barrel., I just dont want all you apple fanboys to switch over to verizon and clog up the verizon network once its available., No actually, the HD2 Stock from tmobile is a MUCH better phone , the only thing that could be better is a better battery life ?, however, it is thinner than the iphone , MUCH faster processor, runs OPERA 9.7 VERY smoothly stock for the browser , has a backup browser of (*cringe* internet explorer 6 mobile) and comes with a 16 gig card stock and almost 700 megs of device installable usable RAM., Which is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy more than even almost 99.9 percent of anyone can use., Along with HSDPA++ (currently almost 10 times the speed of the at&t network in a 3g coverage area (the device itself is not only capable , but uses fast data) ., Makes downloading mp3s a sinch (less than 4 seconds start to finish for a 3 minute 3 megabyte mp3 typically)., The ipoon is a Handheld shop., Everything you use has to use safari to incorporate into it / itunes / whatever apple specific product., On the HTC side, no matter what the phone ., There is no special software to install to update the phone for the most part., If you have windows 2000 or earlier their are downloads., Activesync aside for windows 2000 and windows xp users., Out of the box most new computers only need to plug the phone in to sync data (not to mention EXCHANGE integration directly on the device for the worlds most used e-mail system to date., What better way to use e-mail than to use Outlook ., Even on a Mac , most business users use Outlook., Use Orb which is free from Http://www.orb.com and the experience is full screen 4.2 inches up to 5 megabit streaming from anywhere in real time., Including from webcams , traffic cams that you have setup ., Nothing needs to be downloaded music or video wize anymore., Freeing up the 16 gig card almost completely., So other than the camera which is identical at 5 megapixel ., The htc device (hd2) also has GPS built in to the camera utility (called footprints ) that allows you to geotag the photos as you take them., Video?s can go e-mail , YOUTUBE , mms , or device store ON THE FLY!!!!!!!, oh and did i mention yet , that HTC is known for VERY VERY good reception ., No holding any htc device this way , and call drops????, pick a device any htc device??.., seriously?? How many of you on AT&T have actually sat down with a HTC Touch Pro 2 and used it for more than 1 minute at a store , or sat down with the US Tmobile HTC HD2 ?, Without using the hardware , how can you write something on comparing smartphones ., I see in the picture you have a HD2 and Evo4g ., However it is not the US version it appears to be a european hd2., They are NOT the same beast., In fact the US hd2 has double the ram size., and Rom is COMPLETELY different., Not to mention 3g radio for tmo us is on it., I had an ipoon 4 for about 3 days , couldn?t handle the dropped calls., or SLOW speed of the device , EVEN on wifi (which it kept failing to connect to i might add repeatedly., Other devices have no problem., Apple really needs to step their game up and come out with a FINISHED product instead of releasing products only HALF finished with outstanding issues out of the box., I prefer it over Gnome., I heart KDE., as does the vast majority of the world that uses Linux / UNIX ., yellowdog is aweful *thumbs down*, Verizon does have one of the best marketing schemes in the world., Reality check., I have 1200 phones on verizon for the company i work for ., i have replaced EVERY PHONE at least 2 times over., Some of them Alot more than others., My newest verizon phone is a Blackberry Tour., Which to this moment cannot make calls., it accepts them until i answer , and it ?crackles? to the point the other party can?t understand what im saying ., and then it drops., Verizon will not help me because it is a ?company phone? even though i am an authorized user on the account., the ipad is HORRIBLE as a device., the HP slate has USB and runs a REAL OS (windows 7 home premium) out of the box., However chances are you have never even heard of the HP slate., because of the aggressive apple marketing campaign centered around the ipood and ipud (ipad) and ipoon (iphone)., Rid of the commercials you have seen , marketing crap., Would you have honestly have bought a crappy phone like that , without doing the research first and picking out a couple of alternatives ?, Take for instance the Touch Pro 2., How many of you have picked one up and actually used it as a device., ummm since over 1/3 of apple is owned by Microsoft ., Apple was losing out and almost bankrupt., Microsoft invested several hundred million to help them back to stability) I in fact find that funny., Also one of the largest and widely used applications for a MAC retail is Microsoft Office (for MAC) ., most print shops print at 2400 dpi for images and 600 dpi for photoshop work at 32bits of color seperation., The iphone doesn?t come CLOSE., Stop with the lying., That is EXACTLY true, since 2006 Apple for the most part no longer uses PowerPC chips , and instead are using INTEL chips., Ala same chips that are on a PC., thats good that you can mention 4g , what does 4g have to do with this review ., and which kind of ?4g? are you referring to ?, there are two types ., LTE and WIMAX., Sprint has Wimax , only available in 7 markets currently ., HAWAII ( PICK THE ISLAND) is not among them., you aren?t using 4g anything., HORRIBLE on battery life when using the 4g because 4g has a faster beacon (syn/acknowledgment ) therefor draining the battery that much more., In all actuality there aren?t but a couple of phones in the world that have 4g., your 4g wimax speeds of ?clear? are FAR below the speeds of 4g LTE ., Which is the worlds defacto standard moving forward of 4g?., Verizon and at&t after all spent some odd 11 billion dollars to get the 700 megahertz frequency to build out LTE for this year (late 2010)., This is not an All over phone service or provider., In fact in Visalia , California Clear is just plainly HORRIBLY slow., another company (Clearwire is just as fast (literally) and they are not using ?4g? ., How can you explain that one ?, Clearwire also is in visalia and has its roots in california., go google it if ya want., other than the fact your using USELESS android??? i mean really ., as a home user with out need for e-mail integration or synchronization to exchange i can understand., why get a ?smartphone? at all , if your not going to at least use the e-mail functionality., not just an ?addin? to connect to gmail ., but a full blown e-mail application (Outlook)., I have outlook on my HD2 , runs great !!!!!!!!!!!!!, the ipoon is a micro payment management system
thats all it is., Everything costs?? have to submit to a crap browser , no choice., have to sync with itunes / safari , which in itself is HORRIBLE., If you have to install an apple product to synch your phone your phone is crap., People with iPhones, dumbass?unless you're never on hold & all your conversations are so compelling, which may be case based on this snoozfest post, But if the psychology is not based on rational/practical/factual reasoning, doesn't buying into such psychology make one merely "psycho"?, the Evo and Droid X record their HD video at 25fps,  which is a really horrific frame rate,  especially when the iPhone records HD video at 30fps., the Evo comes with only 9gb of memory and much of it can not be used for apps,  compared with the same price of the iPhone 4 with 16gb of memory?   however the Droid X has 24gb of memory?   but the Droid X can not do the Video conferencing with no forward camera,  and the iPhone's rear camera takes better Pictures overall than the 8gb camera of both the Droid X and Evo? 
the Accelerometer tracking is an order of magnitude better on the iPhone 4 compared to either the Evo or the Droid X 
both the Evo and Droid X run an older version of the Android operating system at 2.1.., the iPhone 4 has been shown to be 27%  faster than the Android 2.1 OS coupled with the snapdragon processors of the EVO and Droid X., the wireless on the EVO is the older standard and is a huge battery hog? 
the EVO has horrific battery life in general,  and the iPhone 4 has been shown in real world tests to be better by far than the EVO and better than the Droid X., 65% of all flash sites crash or do not work on the Evo's or Droid X's implementation of flash, well i mean when they do get flash., number of apps: by far and away the iPhone has an order of magnitude better the number and quality of apps than the EVO and Droid X, for instance in the last few months, the Apple AppStore has gained 25,000 apps, compared to the total number of Android apps of 50,000, yet of the 50,000, only a fraction can actually be used on the Evo or Droid X, due to the unbelievable fragmentation of the Android market into different form factors and OS's that these form factors are forced into using., 90% of which are already out of date? So those developers are all out their investment., and 99% of your statistics are pulled out of your ass 
Evo has flash you fucking idiot, and 99% of your statistics are pulled out of your ass, Iphone doesnt even have flash, so i dont know why this poster even brings it up., its one of those things that apple has been reluctant to adopt even though so many sites use it., These sites simply dont work on the iphone., your talking marginally better specs, for a phone that has reception issues., You might have a nice engine, but its stupid to put it in a pinto., Thats what all you guys are doing when you sign that At&t contract., I was looking for a more objective review, but I kept reading even after the introduction., He did make some good points about why one should upgrade if one owned the previous version of the iphone., What I don?t understand is why he compared the new iphone to older phones except for maybe the EVO., The Incredible is the contender to beat and it wasn?t even mentioned., As some have mentioned, he made a blurb about not being able to do something in the Android OS as apposed to the iOS, but he doesn?t give any examples., IMO the video on the lake was extremely choppy and not worth uploading., It may have looked OK on the phone, but not on this blog post ? I just watched it again and it?s really pretty bad., Don?t even get me started on that FaceTime commercial LOL., As if a hospital is going to let you on their secure WiFi network? Come on, really ? Apple missed the boat on this one., Hmm and his whole quality over quantity rigmarole just doesn?t fly in the real world., Let?s face it, if Microsoft doesn?t pull a miracle out of their butt with WinMobile 7, Google Android will become the mobile OS of choice and become the new ?Windows OS? of the mobile market., Apple is making the same mistakes it made with the Mac., If Apple doesn?t do something soon, the iphone will become just a footnote in history along side the Apple QuickTake camera within the next 1 to 2 years., There is something to be said for the ?it? factor., It?s practically guaranteed that by the time the iphone 5 comes out there will be some amazing smart phones released., If Apple sticks to its current 3 year refresh cycle, they are doomed., Nokia is soon releasing the N8 which boasts a real Xenon flash and Carl Zeiss optics., 720p video with Dolby 5.1 surround via its built-in HDMI output., It?s only a matter time before we begin to see Android phones with similar specs (The Droid X has HDMI out as well)., Indeed the competition is rapidly shaping up ? let?s hope Apple can keep up., iphone4 changes nothing., No voice chat unless you are on wifi limits the function of this phone unlike your review that it will revolutionize things., The Evo allows users to chat non-wifi and actually with iphone 4 users (there is an app for that)., Any smartphone takes time to navigate and the iphone is no different., I went from the iphone to the droid for two reasons: 1., never let a phone pick your carrier?att in my area causes a lot of dropped calls and 2., multitasking., The iphone 4 resolves the multitasking but I have actually grown to like android's ability to allow widgets on your homescreen., I am hoping iphone 5 will come to verizon, allow facetime non-wifi, allow widgets on the homescreen, and allow tethering., Unless you are noob to smartphones, then yes get the iphone4 as there is a smaller learning curve., I am no expert and learning to use an android phone was rather easy (and fun so spending hours personalizing your phone was not a pain in the a$$)., Another minus is Apple's insistence to not allow an exchange of batteries AGAIN limiting function., I run a business and sometimes not near an outlet or vehicle charger., An android phone allows me to pop in a new battery and I am all set?the iphone does not allow this., Apple needs to start listening to consumers like myself and makes these changes or they will continue to slide in the smartphone market., (on a side note, my mobile device is the only non-apple product i own)  and for those comments commenting on processing speeds including video there are links indicating currently the evo beats the iphone 4 hands down and not even close?i don't even own an evo but wished it was on verizon?., I like Apple products., My first computer was an Apple II., However, I don't like the maniacal control that Apple puts on its products., It makes their products inflexible and with inflexibility comes the inability to do certain things., You don?t notice this until competitors come around to show you this., Android is starting to show this and it is only the beginning., Working with Apple reminds me of the movie the Demolition Man, where one man decides everything including that all restaurants should Taco Bell., yeah, also, the reviewer wrote "phase" when he meant "faze"., I'm tempted to be snarky here and point out that even my android phone knows the difference between those two words, but that would just be rubbing salt in your wounds., Why is it so difficult for people to use "your" and "you're" correctly?, I can only assume the author is incompetent whenever I see that., With the AT&T subsidy, knucklehead., Since when do you include the wireless service in the price of a phone?, Do you include the price of gasoline and tune-ups when buying a car?, More to the point, do you include the price of wireless service when talking about Android or RIM devices?, I think it's different in this case, because we're talking about acquiring -just- the phone., The phone itself, is over $600., If an android were to be bundled up to a expensive wireless plan, of course I would consider it, before buying it, especially since it's wise to be a smart, conscious buyer and check the product's characteristics and true costs before buying anything (checking durability, monthly cost, maintenance costs, upgrade costs, etc)., But since there are ways of getting free wireless, and since android doesn't apply forced contracts, I don't consider it in their case., When buying a car, I think that most intelligent people look around to see if what the car will wind up costing them., Calculating the car's maintenance prices, mileage, licensing fees, etc., What the car truly costs at the end., I consider gas prices as well, but I don't necessarily need the exact same gas, from the same gas company, the car's manufacturer recommends me to use., The same way I don't need to use AT&T to use an iphone, so why bundle it?, So, maybe it isn't so crazy to consider the contract., Thanks for pointing that out, Angry internet child!, I have the iphone 3GS and I wanted this review cause he's coming from where I'm coming from., He's a fan of the 3GS and so am I., Is the 4 a big leap forward?, That is my question and he's answered it., Good review from my standpoint., I'm for one am glad you like this, the Iphone., Now How can I get the Nexus one from you?, I truly need a good phone., I return my IPhone 4 after the screen and connection junk., So Could you help with the N1., Horrible review., Your bias is leaking out like a bad case of diarrhea., The video shot from Lake Tahoe is really fine!, Wow, the author has such low standards?, Great review., I have only been an iphone user for 6 months., Before the iphone I have had every blackberry ever created in the US?sad I know., Your review helped me to decide if I should upgrade to an iphone 4., Thank you!, Perhaps Apple should seriolusly think of bringing a new gadget next time than simply improvising previous models., Talking about the glass, it?s just marketing., One of my friends? iPhone 4 screen cracked instantly the moment it fell on asphalt road similar to my 3gS., It wasn?t his mistake but accident and I don?t think the product should be punishing and slapping a 200$ replacement cost., Considering the phones usage Apple should have made the phone more durable and nor merely try to make money out of peoples woes., It?s mean., i don?t know,,but still i can?t take iphone as the best, Great peice, thanks MG., You are missing the point,  all other mobile phones as good as they may be are still trying to copy the iphone., To me that makes it the best phone out there, otherwise they wouldnt want to copy it., And to the att sucking issue,  guess what they do., Everyone i know hates att here it the midwest., Come to think of it all the people i know that have att hate it., Fine, it's a fan boy post, but still it goes a little far., Saying that the "iPhone 4 is the biggest leap forward that any iPhone has taken yet over the previous generation" is ridiculous., There is nothing new here, just a few things are significantly enhanced., You really think this is better than the move from 2.5G to 3G AND 3rd party applications?, That was a game changer., This is just the same phone with 2010 components., If apple does truly open source facetime it then it will probably not be wi-fi only for long., I don't think you have to worry about iPhone on Verizon until they move to LTE., Apple is all about a common user interface., I don't think they would move to CDMA, it's technology does not allow for data and voice and never will., This would be counter to everything that Apple is about., Good thing is CDMA will die soon., The bad thing is that as a voice technology it can't be replaced., A CDMA tower has twice the distance as a GSM or LTE which allows better coverage at all times with with less towers., Rural areas are going to get the shaft., All in all a good article on the iPhone 4, next time I would recommend less talk about other phones although I agree with the Droid fragmentation holding them back., In my opinion Droid should be the Nexus one., You will always have droid fanboys comparing bits and pieces of phones to one phone saying how Droid is better., Droid is an incredible operating system being hampered by low quality phones with the exception of the Nexus One., Yes EVO sorry played with it but it does not compete hardware wise with the iPhone for reasons mentioned above., If the Nexus 2 came out I don't think we would be talking about the iPhone 4, but no we are going to be talking about another sucky Motorola phone., This is the reason that people will continue to wish for an iPhone on Verizon., I had wanted an  iphone since day one., unfortunately in so il ATT is horrible., The one thing iPhone can not give you is choice of carrier., So just a few weeks ago I got a Droid incrediblee., On a tour in ny a new iPhone 4 user complaining about data speed pulling up info was suprised I already had the page up well after they started looking., Then we did a test? before the iPhone could even pull up Google my Droid inc had browsed pages of news and pulled up two articles., The network is much of the iPhones limitation but the snap dragon processor flat out put the iPhone to shame., I don?t hate Apple., But results and speed of the two side by side.., Jon's reference to MG as an author is about as credible as apple's recent "solution" to the reception issue., MG's blatant disregard for all things grammar related are in conjunction with his blatant disregard that this device is a phone., This "take" on the iphone is akin to a "take" on a car without the whole, you know driving thing., The word phone is actually in the moniker iphone., MG and all his apple apologists are the reason I won't become an apple lemming., Well, that and the fact that I need a cellphone which works well as a phone without being told I'm holding it incorrectly., This was NOT sent from an iphone., Could you BE more biased?!!, I don't think any smartphone without a physical keyboard will ever be truly smart., The ifags are stupid and easily impressed., Apple strips out important, normally expected features, then turns around and offers em for sale through only their own outlets!, They are the ULTIMATE NICKLE AND DIMERS!, An apple biased review?.., Do you get paid by apple for writing reviews?, Either you haven?t really used any other phones
Than iPhone or just an iPhone lover., I have 2 iPhone 3GS, and one iPhone 4 and the
I iPhone 4 sucks.., Basic function of.a phone is
The ability to make and receive calls, if that doesn?t function well you better not to call it as a phone? 
I will be replacing all iphones with android driven  phones,, This guy is an epic tool., You don't even address the proximity sensor issues?  Did you really use this for a week?, My iPhone 4 is heading back to Apple ASAP., Calls are constantly interrupted by the faulty sensor taking input from my face ? hanging up, failing calls, dialing numbers, putting other party on hold, etc., With a case, the reception problems are FAR less worrisome than the proximity problems, which threaten to force me back to a 3GS or different phone line, entirely., I have an iPhone 3.1 but may switch to Android, because it doesn't have Flash compatability., I need to access some Flash-built websites, which are mission critical for me., Therefore, my iPhone limits my access, wheras ATT has provided excellent access where I live., This review is good, but the lack of info about Flash is dissapointing., Question 1: Can the new iPhone email more than one photo at a time yet?, So you get NOTHING in data, cellular services, etc?this is ridiculous.., Where do people get this $3000 number?, I calculated my plan $70 times 12 months., It doesn't add up.., facetimes brilliantly easy, i wonder though?? where am i going to find a wifi network on a boat in lake tahoe, when i really want to show off where im at???, i know ill use my friends EVO to create the hotspot., ooohhhh wait, my new iphones fallen in the water cause i was holding it with two fingers cause i didnt want to lose signal., dude, i used the iphone for 3 days, gave it to my 17 year old brother., he's using it to show off to his friends, which i think its all it may be good for., Walk, no, run to get your own!, "The manufactures make 15-20 phones a year, Apple makes 1, so yeah obviously Apple can spend more time optimizing their phone, but who cares."
Well, I do!, Android has a nightmare with which phones can keep up with their updates., "Quick example, Apple spends their time and money optimizing the Macs, but they will never put a dent in Windows share."
Watch out, they are doing that., And Mercedes Benz and BMW have a similar market share, but, then I will quote you, "who cares?", Do a review on why the iphone is years behind the competition!, Why is no one mentioning the fact that android phones have removeable, and therefore updateable, memory?, I have an iTouch, and I wish I would have kept my iPod video., I always said that after using the iTouch, I would never get a touch screen phone, until I played with a friends android., Love that I have the choice between the touch screen keyboard and the real keyboard., Does the iPhone have swype?, And I can download and listen to music using a few different programs, I'm not limited to iTunes, and don't have to worry about my music being "protected"., I can do whatever I want with it., I've yet to find anything my friends can do on their iPhone that I can't do on my droid., AND I even have a few friends that were VERY excited to finish serving their time with AT&T so they could get a droid :), Consumer Reports will not recommend buying the iphone4., iPhone 4G'zy, MG, i am MG as well [michael g.] :)? i too LOVE my iPhones!, [so much, i seeked and bought a t-shirt from Hong Kong saying so!] lol., since my first iPhone i have testified that the iPhone is the best &hottest thing on the planet!, i love the speed of my new iPhone 4-it's simply incredible!.., i am concerned over issues related to voice clarity/sound quality while utilizing the bluetooth [something, if not corrected w/a software update, will surely drive me to returning my beloved device], and have not experienced the serious issues of dropped calls and proximity sensor which have much been discussed online., i live and work in the Bay area as well., question for you: do you use your iPhone 4 w/ or w/o a bumper on a daily basis?.., What are your feelings on the fact that incoming calls & texts interrupt FaceTime?, (something that's really beginning to PEEV me off!), "Slightly" biased?, (It's "biased," not "bias.") 
I never gave much weight to the idea that people could honestly and sincerely tout their own opinions/preferences as 'facts' when it came to things like mobile electronics, but the more articles like this I read, the more I realize I was wrong., Good review but your forgot to include the proximity censor issues., I?m an iPhone user from day one 2G and this phone pissed me off constantly, how they couldn?t test these type of things before they released this blows my mind?, So Consumer Reports says this phone sucks, a group that actually watches out for the interests of consumers., How much did Apple pay you to shill their shit, MG?, near as I can figure, if you like Iphones and Apple products, you're going to love the Iphone 4., If you simply look at them as competing products, then it may or may not be for you., At the least the author said up front he's an Apple fanatic, Your mother story sounds a little too much like an Apple fanboy trying to get others on his own bandwagon., iPhone and Android phones are both icon based touchscreen phones that have basic interfaces for basic functions such as making calls or telling you the time., Unless your mother was trying figure out how to make Android be limited and restrictive as the iPhone, I can't imagine what the problem would be., so your acknowledging the iphone doesnt do this readily right out of the box?, that's the point., the average user is NOT going to jailbreak their phone to make it do what android phones already do out of the box., thank you., or you can get an iphone and let steve jobs dictate how you use it, what apps you can and cant use, and also keep you from having the freedom of customizing the phone to YOUR liking., Why does AT&T have such shitty service in the 2 of the largest cities in the US?, (not necessarily THE largest for those of you who will argue, but still undoubtingly large), There ARE open sourced programs., But overall ? apple is not known for this., That's some good wisdom!, as much as you'd like to think? try finding a reviewer that isn't biased., It's human nature ? even if they TRY not to, it's impossible., Becasue even if you dont' say " i like this phone better" by making a bad review, your biased to another ? and it's probably a specific other., You've all seen this, for sure., Apparently, MG is the "I don't care" character: http://images.intellicast.com/WxImages/RadarLoop/?, If you wait 6 months, you'll end up with an Android phone., Motorola will have its 2GHz handset out and the iphone 4 will look like a dinosaur in comparison., Or you can wait another year for the iphone 5 and maybe it will match the best HTC or Motorola out at the time, or maybe it won't., I'm an app scroller and I agree with thythy., I spend all day scrolling through my apps and it really is seamless., Right again on the camera, though with your thinking, 3 megapixels is more than enough and why are Android phones now supplying HDMI outputs?, Just because you can take HD videos, why would you want to watch them on your HDTV with a convenient HDMI cable?, You're just going to put them up on YouTube right?, I also love iTunes., I need it for everything I do on the iPhone with my computer, I love it, I love it, I love it., It is great that I need to constantly download a new update for iTunes so that I can get a new update for my phone., And it works so flawlessly on a PC., Let me guess, it's the PC's fault if it doesn't, but it's Adobe's fault that flash crashes on a Mac., I once used my Android phone to track my run, while I was streaming music with Pandora, when someone stopped me to ask directions., I was able to use Google maps to find the address while the music played and Buddy Runner kept track of how long I was "idle" and started the clock again once I was back on my run., BTW, Swype kicks ass, but iPhone users won't experience it because Apple wouldn't dare let you deviate from the intended Apple experience., I just threw up a little bit., I?m hooked, and use it  for work and personal., No antenna issues at all., Fast downloads, especially on wifi., It does work., so don't be sad, put that toy 2 for the price of 1 phone down and step up and get an iphone 4!, Haven't had a problem with the iphone 4 or 3GS since day one., @Tferd ? you are incorrect., OS X (10.4+) is a very capable OS, clearly more capable than WinXP (I can't comment on Win7)., I don't get the sense you have enough long-term experience with professional-grade systems running both platforms to give an informed judgment., thank you, tried Iphone 4, Evo, and Incredible., Incredible with Verizon worked best for me., Leo is actually a critical thinker., This person isn't a thinker at all., this is the most biased review ever, talk about a fanboy.., this is entirely opinion and nothing of fact., android is available on all networks, find one on your provider and you'll be far better off than buying this phone, Says it all:  Bottom line ? If you want to be iSheep get the iPhone., Android delivers everything that the iPhone currently has + freedom of choice., "Shoppers snapped up 1.7 million iPhone 4s in the three days after they went on sale nearly all of which were acquired as upgrades from iPhone 3s"  
Ggoes to show Apple fans have more money than sense if they can toss their phones out for a new one every year or so., Apple has a great marketing program ? find a bunch of consumers with ample disposable income and keep selling them an upgraded phone year after year simply by appealing to desire to have the "latest and greatest" regardless of truth or practicality ? Are their consumers that shallow?, That gullible?, Or just willing to readily part with their money and support a "closed system"?, I am glad to see eveyone else thinks this guy is a douche., Stop writing, please, for the love of god., And, to justify a defect?you are really a tool that is not worthy of publishing or posting anything ever again., I just wasted part of my life reading this crap and posting a comment on it., O, and where the hell are the BB?s., You leave them out of every picture and fail to comment on any of them?, I get it?they are better and you can?t risk having a resonable debate in the article or comments., LOL ? you are a joke!, I've been a loyal Apple consumer for years but my iPhone 4 is constantly dropping calls., This problem is not imaginary., Perhaps it depends on location but the "death grip" is not something I should have to worry about., My coffee maker does not tell me to hold the cup in a certain way or I will not get a caffeine fix., Apple, recall now, or say goodbye to my business forever!, Having not read all the comments, not sure this was covered, but things didn?t seem to be trending this way., My biggest issue, surprisingly not a lot of other people?s, is the lack of personal control you have over the I phone., can?t change the battery, can?t access the sim card, can?t run it on other networks., The way everyone seems to just take it for granted that you spend huge dollars for a piece of technology that you are then told how you can use it., Suppose you bought a car and had to take it to this shop or it would stop working, or where you could drive it, or it would stop working., Seems to me that all you apple lovers have just ?drunk the kool-aid? no questions asked, yes Mr Jobs, how high did you say?, I mean really, it?s just a phone with some really pretty flashing lights., If you are REALLY interested in which carrier's signal strength, data transmission, etc., work best in your neighborhood, check out this site:   http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phone-coverage-map/?? 
You may be surprised; you may be dismayed., But if you are in the market for a new cellphone (and maybe a new carrier), the site is definitely worth checking out if it's findings cover your home turf., I get AT&T GREAT., I can't use a Verizon cellphone, period., I had a Verizon phone w/a TWO year contract but could not receive or make any calls in my own home., Despite that, they refused to let me out of my contract., When my contract was finally up, I got an iPhone G3; in the last 20 months have had a total of 2 dropped calls., I love the phone (it's so much more than just a phone., When the time comes, I will definitely buy an iPhone 4 (or whatever is around then)., Since buying my iPhone in October 2008, Verizon has yet to invest in any new towers or upgraded technology in my rather URBAN LA neighborhood., Neighbors and visitors who have Verizon phones still cannot use them here., So I get really irritated with their blizzard of ads about how great their service is everywhere., Every wireless provider has dead spots and areas with spotty service., Don't confuse the carrier's coverage service with the reliability of any cellphone., If a particular cellphone won't perform well with any provider, then it's not worth buying., I've got an adapter to charge my iPhone in my car as well as one that I plug into any outlet., You raised a false issue in my mind., Thank you for such an objective comment., It is so RARE for the rabid ANTI-Apple folks., I am definitely an Apple fan, but not blindly so., I've had simple cell phones with crappy Verizon coverage that probably would have been fine with AT&T or T-Mobile., I currently have an iPhone 3G and great AT&T service., if so please return it and live with other phones that you like!, I don?t get why iPhone fanatics continually point to Android phones and their ?shitty? battery life., Sure, that is a problem with some phones, particularly the HTC Incredible, but the Motorola Droid X, which comes out tomorrow, reportedly does a better job not only with battery life, but giving you control of how much you want it to spend on specific tasks., That said, even without better battery management, which new Android?s will hopefully have, we can do one thing that iPhone owners can?t, and that?s just take out the battery and replace it with a fully charged one., When on long trips, that?s usually been my practice, charge two batteries, and take them with me., If one runs out, I have a newly charged one, ready to go., When the battery of your iPhone runs out, you either need to find an outlet, drain your laptop?s battery to recharge or wait until you can recharge, as happened to one of my friends on one of our trips, while I happily continued to listen to music., That?s just one more way in which Apple controls your lives., Mark, iPhone is for narrow minded people just like MG Siegler., In other words, the Apple way is the only way even though it's sheer crap!, With the reception problem the new iPhone is having, MG is even a fan of that because it gives the iPhone that human touch of imperfection., MG says iPhone just wants to be lulled when your phone calls go out on you., Hey MG, its so cool the upcoming iPhone recall!, I smell a recall!, Woot woot woot!, The nerd frenzy has reached a fever pitch with this antenna "issue"., I see nerds left and right blowing conniptions over the fact that the EVO (or whatever phone) has x more megapixels, is open source, has xyz feature and can calculate the theoretical possibility of time travel in five dimension., All of these may be true but nerds need to get over the fact that MOST PEOPLE LOOKING FOR THE IPHONE ** DO NOT CARE **., Not because they are stupid, but because MOST OF THESE SO-CALLED "SUPERIOR FEATURES" ARE OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE TO THE AVERAGE HUMAN BEING THAT DOESN'T WEAR A POCKET PROTECTOR!, The same exact reason Linux failed is why these "superior phones" are going to be ignored in favor of the iPhone., Most of the people buying these phones AREN'T GEEKS!, Get it now?, Here we go with the nerd arguments which are outside of what attracts users to the phone., No one needs what you're pointing out., Just because you like those things doesn't mean everyone else in the world does., They just use the features that appeal to them., "Voice integration" and "customization" ARE NOT high on their list., Have you considered that Steve Jobs' choices might be aligned with the average user of the iPhone?, Why does no one complain that they can't modify their microwave oven., That argument is ridiculous!, When you start with a prejudiced attitude, don't be surprised when you come up with exactly the results you desired., This was not a review, this was an advertisement., There was no objectivity in this article at all., If I wanted to read stuff like this I would look at iPhone commercials., If I want to get an objective review, I will visit other sites (and there are a LOT of other sites much more objective than this one)., When Verizon switches to 4G LTE later this year the data vs voice issue will be moot as the new technology will do both., With the release today of the Verizon Wireless Android X you may as well drop the iPhone in the nearest waste receptacle., I assume that you know that the "bars" on the phone are only the measure of the signal received FROM the tower and have nothing to do with the strength of the transmission from the PHONE to the tower?, Most dropped calls in any cellular situation are because the signal from the phone back to the tower isn't sufficient to allow the tower know it is still there so the tower says "f" it and drops the connection., It's so funny to read user comments because I'm an iphone owner and I have been using macs at home but PCs (good PCs) at work and anyone that can't see that this iphone is everything it says it is crazy., nothing comes close to the iphone and PCs are annoying and clunky compared to my macbook., "The manufactures make 15-20 phones a year, Apple makes 1, so yeah obviously Apple can spend more time optimizing their phone, but who cares., Quick example, Apple spends their time and money optimizing the Macs, but they will never put a dent in Windows share." 
Well, yeah!, And Lamborghini will never overtake Ford in total units sold either, but sheer beauty and design perfection trumps all, regardless?.., Not a bad review, but you forgot to mention the lack of Flash being available on the iPhone which is pretty annoying., You people are scary ? if Apple said "offer up your first child as a sacrifice"  you yahoos would probably offer up all  your kids to prove their devotion., You people need to stay the hell away from civilized folks and get a lot of therapy., You're more messed up in the head than suicide bombers ? as sick as suicide bombers  are,  at least they think they're going to heaven., You people are  like a crazy cult that worships an inanimate object., You should  be required to register like sex offenders., People should know when one of you looney tunes lives in their neighborhood., The worst thing you could do is buy an iPhone 4., Keep your 3G(S) and wait until next year., The iPhone 4 will NOT be compatible with the 4G network so if you do decide to get the new iPhone 4 (complete with all of its issues), you will be need to replace it in 6 months anyway., Sad but True, Two guesses: (1) you are gay, and (2) you have not gotten laid in about 18 months., Tech = man-crush., Poor reception, attention to details no one else cares about while ignoring the glaring flaws, etc = need an outlet., I work at a print shop thank you very much, and most ALL printers, print at 300 ? 600 dpi (some even lower if printing on plastic or difficult materials)., There really is no point to print much higher unless you were using a magnifying glass., Stop YOUR lying., Your loyalty to Apple is to be commended, but only a complete moron would recommend a product that has a major design flaw., It's a phone!, Calls shouldn't be dropped when you hold it, so basically Apple just sold you a defective product., By using your buying power to encourage this type of shoddy engineering, where consumers are the patsy, frankly I think you deserve the iPhone., You've got to be kidding., It constantly drops frames and the lack of 4g makes it already obsolete., I have the HTC EVO, with no battery problems and the multitasking alone makes it far superior to the Iphone., Apple has seen its better days and everyone else is not only catching up but surpassing it., It's an inferior product and you're paying for the name only., No the HTC HD2 has 1024 MB ROM and 768 MB RAM and includes out of box a 16 gig card., Processor in both the Evo4g and HTC HD2 is a snapdragon 1.0 and 1.1 ghz respectively processor., screensize is also larger, Both models are just as thin as the ipoon., .38 inch thick., If you want to get down at the nitty gritty at least know what you are talking about., In all actuality the HD3 has been going through patenting to come out in november 2010 , which has a 1.5ghz processor , 8 megapixel camera and 1080I video recording, not to mention windows phone 7 (COMPLETELY different beast than previous windows mobile devices)., See , now in all actuality it is , HTC themselves have a FREE program for both android and windows mobile devices for free wifi hotspot?.., you should look into this before you blab about how it doesn?t exist , and or it costs., In reality its COMPLETELY FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, In fact someone reviewing a saw movie?., just say gore , pointlessness , more gore, stupid lines , and last ?., more gore?? that would about sum it up., I could honestly give a crap less about someone who liked saw5 to review ?saw6? ., In fact thats shunned upon if anything., No , it will not be taken care of ., Only temporarily will apple be offering ?bumpers? for the 4g , steve jobs is arrogant and should be shot., trying to make a claim against HTC and RIM is typically grounds for a lawsuit., In fact I have the device from HTC that apple claims has a ?signal problem? ?.., in all actuality NO THERE IS NO PROBLEM with it at all ., i used the device for 3 years WITHOUT A SINGLE PROBLEM , I am LEFT handed., hold it with my left hand., On the ipoon 4 , i held it it dropped my TEST call not once but twice FROM THE STORE., Good enough for me to say NO they should be SUED., android fans rave about the voice search and crap?., meanwhile TELLME from microsoft is not just for smartphones but BCM50 and 60 Nortel networks and Key systems for offices as well., Integration across a domain for all users voice search on Blackberrys , Windows mobile 6.5 phones and upcoming windows phone 7 along with PRI lines at the office., SEAMLESS integration., google really needs to step up the voice search game., TellMe works SOOOOOOOO much faster., ummmm , I do on my HD2 just fine and dandy., The network is the biggest limitation ., for instance ANYONE ON VERIZON currently cannot do this., You actually can?t even accept email on a blackberry while your on the phone., it sits in queue until about a minute or two AFTER your done with your phone call., no but facetime is HORRIBLE., see HTC has done FAR more development on a similar technology ., Those that have the EVO can use their wimax to have a face to face chat., The facetime is NOTHING special., I was doing that with OctroTalk in the days of windows mobile 6.1 at 25 frames per second 640 X 480 res ., I am also a Network Engineer for a very large company (also known as GC ) ., No GSM does not suffer from any sort of signal degrading when used under pressure., That is why CDMA technology has a limitation called EVDO rev A ., A hurdle that just can?t be jumped over., That will alievate the hurdle all together., However CDMA bleeds and is succeptible to crosstalk., I have several tests showing this and can send viable data if need be., GSM as far as data goes is HSDPA++ on tmobile currently about 10 times faster REAL WORLD RESULT than ?verizon? or at&t ., Sprints ?wimax? still doesnt? compare with HSDPA++ ., LTE awesome , but reality check we are about 3 ? 4 years off of actually using the infrastructure for the speed it was made for regardless of the hype behind it., why do people want this device to come to verizon ?, verizon is the SLOWEST NETWORK ON THE PLANET LITERALLY ., MAX evdo rev a they claim is 700kpbs ., real world , on a blackberry is 330kpbs , windows mobile 459kpbs over and over tested ., tried and true with 5 bars of service and ?1x EV? ., The phone should come to tmobile and apple needs to give it a HSDPA++ radio., we?re talking MEGABITS there., No , actually those of us with windows mobile 6.5 have ?VOICE COMMANDER? one of the features of voice commander is the ability to say ? WHAT IS MY SIGNAL STRENGTH , and WHAT IS MY NETWORK STATUS., you know occasionally when using a mom and pop cell tower it drops down ., however day to day since i?m on TMOBILE my signal strength even while MOVING is almost exactly the same., anywhere here in the largest ?valley? in the world (phoenix) it works pretty darn well actually., ALOT better than verizon , which cuts out and drops every chance it gets., AT&t isn?t much better :-(, you said itunes?., in a perfect world , 99 percent of all devices EXCEPT the ipoon and apple products?.., dont use Itunes?., WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO?, it is a service., slows down your computer., installs three , yes count them three pieces of software that severely change how you do things ?, How about NO?., I should be able to just plug it in USB and drag drop music on to the device., EVERYONE BUT APPLE and APPLE CLONES YOU CAN DO THIS., for christs sake guys , it is a hard drive ., and why not ?, Itunes is HORRIBLE., you have to install quicktime ?, its called QTTASK.exe and IPODSERVICE.exe look into it., always on and always slowing your computer down., Not anymore i already took it back ., apple didn?t like it and didn?t want to honor it., but after a lawsuit , they backed down., You obviously haven't checked out the new EVO 4G smart phone., The iPhone is old news and way behind the curve., Sorry, not biased here I have the new EVO 4G and it is absoultely amazing., I checked out the iPhone and tested everything before I made my decision., iPhone does have better display screen but that's not what sold me., It's everything else the iPhone doesn't do and smaller screen., APPLE= Better phone, better computers and most of all THE BEST service by any big corporation,
also it has store fronts that creates 1000s of jobs, they are staffed with knowledgeable people that can answer or fix your problem on the spot., RIMM, GOOGLE, MOTOROLA, HTC, NOKIA and all the rest= They have none of the above., Service 0 (try to get someone at the Verizon store to answer a complicated question :)., No storefront by this guys, so they create 0 jobs., They have inferior products next to IPhone, sorry guys, don't kill the messenger., Okay, software, bumper whatever ? is ANYBODY going to talk about whether or not they are actually going to FIX the problem in production?, iPhone 4 is a sexy azz device., I like them both but the iPhone 4 is sexy., I'm gonna buy it in September after they fix the antenna., Androids have too much lag at the worst possible moments., I'll be texting and it'll get lag and send out text to the wrong person., Steve Jobs is the new Denzel; sexy as hell, Fanboys of any object or medium simply cannot see the forest for the trees., I enjoy reading reviews of the iPhone, as I will be getting one shortly (I've been enjoying my partner's iPhone 4 for the past two weeks)., I have to say, however, that writers who use spell check and grammar check come across as more knowledgeable than those who don't., There are numerous spelling errors ("your" instead of "you're" and "phase" instead of "faze") that show laziness., If you are lazy in publishing something you want thousands or millions to read, how accurate are you in the reporting itself?, Spell check is not difficult., So, does anyone know: 
Question 1: Can the new iPhone email more than one photo at a time yet?, Meet the iDouchbags? These guys sound like a bunch of cackling valley girls., "Like, so, have you guys seen this show? OMG!, its like!, (on exhale) so friggin awesome", check out this video-  awesome

Also, even using the shitty and slow iTunes icon arrangment features is painful., To MG: Mate, you need to marry with Steve Jobs as you're already in love ? this review lacks of any kind of common sense and good perspective., You're more apple fanboy than Jobs himself?

Now you know why the FM is not turned on even though it is in the phone., Now you know why flash memory cards are not supported., And you also know why that antennagate started (something to do with radiation)., Read the link above if you are interested., Not only are you all funny, but you are all correct too (well, mostly)., I enjoyed the read and the comments, but I?m still on the fence with the iPhone 4., I?m going to stick with the 3GS for now and stay in wait-and-see mode until there are more carrier options., ?I don?t know anyone who doesn?t hate AT&T, and their lies about coverage.?
Laci, your comment above is a good example of ?anecdotal? evidence which is fallacious., You see it all the time in advertising., (Usually called a ?testimonial.?)
I can truthfully say that I don?t know anyone who hates AT&T., So, which statement is valid logically: yours or mine?, The answer is neither., I can also say, truthfully, that my problems with AT&T are less troublesome than they were when I was with Verizon., Am I a ?shill? because I disagree with you?, Shouldn?t there be an age limit on these replies?, Many seem to be written by barely literate teens, and most of these fail to heed the elementary rules of logic., A shining example of the pre-literate types who seem to haunt blogs like this one., ?AcidAngel111,? perhaps you should stop dropping acid and crack open your English textbook., (Or, stay awake in class.), You dropped your Palm Treo ?many? times on wood, tile, concrete and asphalt?, I don?t get the constant comparisons between Android and iPhone., In my eyes, the comparison is between the new breed of smart phone (iPhone, Android, Palm Pre, Blackberry Storm), feature phones and tablets., Every iPhone sold benefits the Android market and reverse., It?s all about increasing the capabilities of an all-in-one device, not about which particular all-in-one is the ?winner?., From what I can tell, both Apple and Google are winning, big time., Maybe neither of you know anyone with an opinion on AT&T?, Then you?re both right!, The only ones that don?t like the Iphone are the ones that don?t have it!, I have used every service and I will stick with at&t., It depends on where you live!, I have never had a dropped call here in Texas nor in Arizona or Indiana., In mountain areas I have but so does everyone else, I have read at&t?s contract with apple,no one is getting the Iphone until 2012 unless at&t agrees to it., T mobile is the likely to get the Iphone., Apple knows that Verizon would have more problems than at&t with high data usage., Exclusivity is apples trademark way of doing business so why would they want to mass produce and not make as much money., Droids flavor of the month may be for some but I will pass.I have loved every version of the iphone had a droid and sent it back so please all of you verizoneers go out and buy droids., I own Macs and PC?s ,there are things I like about both and the same goes for cell phones but I have experienced all the Microsoft/Google problems I want in a life time!, I don?t need that in a phone as well!, How much did Apple pay Google to keep this
fawning article on the front page for so long?, Please note that this message was typed
by a computer., I?m too poor to have either an iphone or an android phone so I can only dream and take vicarious pleasure in posts such as these., As such, this is an ?Ode to the iPhone? ? it can hardly pass as a review or analysis., Readers? comments about how one missing feature of the other guys? phone makes it absolutely unusable (No GVoice?!, Pshaw!) show precisely why a balanced, objective review of each phone is necessary ? so a reader can judge the device holistically., Now, MG, how ?bout showing me a little love and sending me one of those ten phones you?ve got laying around the house (except the Razr)., Great close-up shot of the screens ? very nice comparison., Maybe this has been said before (sorry, I just *can?t* read through all 500+ comments) ? but it?s interesting your article is still linked on Google?s news site, after all this time., What gives?, It?s become a permanent feature article for the competition., Funny Apple fanboys dont read blogs it seems, then why do they bother writing them?, I have never read such an apple fanboyish post., Talk about buttering and sweetening the whole article., Looks like an ad for iPhone from Steve Jobs personal blog., Casue more mp = better
/sigh, I?m on AT&T., Love it., Now, you can stop saying everyone you know hates AT&T., David Rudder, maybe you should think a bit before you imply that someone is a liar, or, maybe you should read my post again so that you understand its point., Cause more MP = Better pictures right?, You my friend, need to look into some facts as well? (before ranting off), I?ve been doing this since 2008, for free on an iphone 3g., when he says it?s not free, he means there are extra carrier fee?s, and there are., I love android, but if you think one is a walled garden and one isn?t, then your a fanboy., Offering tethering has more to do with the carrier than the phone, any smartphone can do it., by the way, you can get widgets on cydia, although there not really necessary., You can get around iOS a ton quicker than Froyo (sorry, it?s true) 
The Post is total flamebait to android users, but please, you make everyone look slightly less smart when you freak out., yeah, it really did kde bad didn?t it?, having google and apple upstreaming brought your kiddy browser to the limelight., Webkit is used for a ton of browsers now, but yeah, 
it totally sucks that we have new standards compliant browsers with lightning fast rendering engines., this is why the comments on this site need a rating system., dear omgwtf2:
all android devices that are in the near price range of subsidized iphone 4?s are themselves also subsidized, meaning that you are locked into a data and phone provider with a data plan for 2 years., It?s the same deal., Google is no more open than apple really, they require google marketplace, they require google search etc., One difference is apple doesn?t allow carrier?s to put software on their phones, as androids are now feeling., Keeping an old unlimited data plan with at&t (who has excellent coverage in some area?s and is just plain bad in others) is far far cheaper than any comparable verizon wireless data plan., Apple approach to multi-tasking is purely different from androids for the sake of battery life on the system., The API?s seem few, but the developers have found ways to do everything, all while maintaining superior power management., Examples are music in an app in the background, uploading to FTP/dropbox, Video streaming etc., There?s nothing the iphone 4 can not background., At that point, imo, the Android multi tasking becomes inferior due to more tasks using more battery power., I?ve extensively used an EVO, and there is a ton it can?t do that my current phone (an iphone 4) can., 802.11n, makes streaming 720p to the device fast and easy, and makes VNC so much more useable (and there is no Android Market place VNC app that is useable for periods of more than 2 min, i have tried)
Fast user switching for me, in iOS 4 has the additional benefit of turning into basically, a frequently used apps list., I am proficient in Froyo, and there is no way you can get around it as fast as this., And i like to get shit done., the android rooting scene being compared to the jailbreak scene is a little rich too, and rooting is not in any way easier, several of geohots and swift are both 1 button jailbreaks., your info is out of date, and your post looks like it was written by a child., That slate was canned., (hence why it?s still not out yet) There is a new one with WebOS (remember, the palm pre?) Coming out soon., and by the way, while microsoft and vendor?s tried for 10 years, they couldn?t sell 500k., It?s a solid device, you should use one for a few weeks before drinking a bunch of jolt cola and commenting., there never more than $199 to fix, that?s the top tier repair i believe., I?ve replaced those tiny square screens on treo?s before, from people who?ve dropped them from less of a distance, so count yourself lucky., As all smarphones get larger and larger screens, they chance of them breaking will grow., If you don?t like it, keep using your treo., I love my iPhone 3GS, and I generally like Apple products., The thing is that version 1.0 of any product usually still has kinks in it that need straightening out., Any company cannot escape this, not even Apple., The iPhone 4 (or more like 4.0) has so many new innovations and I really like it as a whole., But I?ll wait for next year?s iPhone 4.1 or 4S or whatever before upgrading., By then hopefully they?ll have fixed the antenna problem for good and not just with workarounds., Don?t see the need for hateful replies., The author clearly states they are biased so they gave fair warning., While I am not inclined to lend the author any serious technical credentials, they seem capable of speaking to the common person., The iPhone is a great device for the average person wanting a little technology benefits in their lives., It even has a place in business if your needs are fairly straight forward., Apple has always been the best at designing tech solutions for those not in the tech business themselves., I feel there are better choices for mobile professionals wanting a little more bang for their buck as Apple does limit you to playing within their well defined sandbox., However, if you can get what you need done within that sandbox, you will very much enjoy Apples products., This entire story is a fake, fraud and phony!, My friends with the new phone seem to be frustrated with service issues., What good is your shiny toy if it don?t work?, ATT is the worst service out there, Sprint has more dependable service and Verizon takes the trophy!!, I live in a local where many carry two cell phones ? one for work and one for personal use., Many have the super secure Blackberry (like the one carried by White House staff)., I carry two iPhones, a 3G and an iPhone 4., About 90% of those I see with their gov?t issued Blackberries have iPhones as their second phones, not a second Blackberry., The big problem with the iPhone is AT&T., Solve that problem and the iPhone is not only the best phone, nothing else even comes close., screen on the left hand iphone looked blurry but i presume it was the one u thought was superior eg the IP4 ?, I think there is another huge design flaw in the iPhone 4 that no one has acknowledged., The way that the phone?s screen ?deactivates? or goes black when you place the phone to the side if you face when making a call is flawed and I would guess accounts for a majority of the dropped calls and people are just blaming the antenna issue., I am left handed and even after I placed a bumper on the phone I continued to drop a significant number of calls., I then realized that the sensitivity of how the screen ?deactivates? does not appear to be as sensitive as my old iPhone 3Gs., I realized that when either holding the phone to my face with my hand or with my shoulder I was inadvertedly pressing buttons on the screen., I was often pressing the end call button but I also was pressing mute, dialing conference calls, pressing the speaker button, etc., Hardcore iPhone users should understand the issue well., I am not sure how to get Apple to review this issue but I would guess that a software fix could address the issue and repair a lot of the damage to the iPhone?s reputation!, THere are two ways to answer this review., One is with facts about the design., For example the antenna issue has turned out to be unique to the IPhone 4., WHile it is entirely true that all phones lose some signal when the phone is covered with the hand, no phone loses signal for the reason the Iphone 4 does, or to anywhere near the degree that the IPhone 4 does., Jobs was being disingenuous when he showed all the other phones losing signal when being held, and he knows it., The Iphone has been shown to lose 28db or even higher when a moist hand (normally moist not soaked in water) holds the phone so that the antenna segments are bridged., No other phone loses any signal far this reason, and no other phone comes within an order of magnitude (X 10) of this much signal loss., In most cases the signal loss for other phones (or even an IPhone 4 in a case)  is only single digits, so perhaps 2 orders of magnitude less than iphone4)., As to how the market is reacting to the iphone in general or the 4 in particular?  there have been some very interesting statistics released over the past month that don?t exactly jibe with many people?s feeling that the IPhone 4 is the dominant smartphone for the forseable future., During the last quarter (before IPhone 4 was released) Android phones took several % points of market share away from Apple., 160,000 Android phones were being sold per day during that time., Since the release of the IPhone 4, which Apple claims is their record holder for sales, Apple hasn?t averaged 160,000 phones per day., But more importantly, 77% of IPhone 4 sales were to people who already had an Iphone, while less than 10% of Android sales were to someone who had an android phone (because practically nobody had an Android phone several months ago), which means that Android is getting new users at about 5 times the rate than IPhone is., In fact there are statistics that show that IPhone is actually losing customers faster than they are getting new ones., If we look down the raod to the ned of summer I can see Apple slipping behind Android., Chris12163 your moms on the phone!, (Chris is only 6? Its past his bedtime)., The words you are straining for are:
You?re (You are), not your, and
Faze, not Phase, I?ve used other smartphones, I?ve been on Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile so I have some perspective., The iPhone 4 IS the best smartphone on the market by a long shot and it isn?t the specs so much as it is the overall experience and the way Apple so skillfully blends all of these many technologies into one device so that it seems effortless and as if it could not have been made any other way., I?m sorry, it?s just not in the ballpark., It harkens back to a model of smartphone where you take this part and that part and add an OS then put a nice face on the OS, then some tools from this bin; it feels cobbled together by comparison., Android IS a viable smartphone no question, but it lacks the polish and usefulness of the iPhone still., But I?m glad Android is there, that someone is there, to push Apple to add features., And it isn?t just the phone, the way you sync it, the way it works with MobileMe, the Universe of apps and accessories that make the iPhone 4 what it is, makes all other phones also-rans., One thing I don?t agree with, is your recommendation of Verizon., Maybe because you live in San Fran and experience less-than-good AT&T connections you think that having an iPhone on Verizon would be a good thing., My experience with Verizon here in Atlanta was a nightmare., They nickel-and-dime you to death, their customer service is arrogant and lousy and I couldn?t get a signal on my own phone in my own house without walking around to find a good signal., I complained and after some ?research? on their part they concluded I wasn?t a candidate for getting out of my contract early., When I switched to AT&T I got a strong signal at my house and just about everywhere I go here in the city and when I travel my phone is very usable just about everywhere., I drive from Atlanta to the Jersey Shore every summer and my iPhone and Pandora are my music, plugged into my head-unit and aside from a few (less than half-a-dozen) times when the signal would drop for a minute in a valley in the boonies, I get Pandora playing strong and clear all the way., So your hatred of AT&T is based on where you live., I live in America and I?m a happy customer of AT&T and I don?t get surprises in my bill each month like I did with Verizon., It?s pie-in-the-sky., The reason Verizon seems to have the better signal overall is CDMA which has better low-signal connectivity in the hinterlands and in lousy cells but come January Verizon will switch to a 4G network., The Verizon iPhone, if there is one, will be 4G, Jobs will NOT hobble his baby with a CDMA network, so Verizon will be rolling out both 4G on a limited-basis and a new iPhone which will sell like hotcakes., AT&T has a mature 3G network with some bad spots., What do you think will happen when Verizon rolls out a new, limited network and the iPhone at the same time?, I predict disaster., And if you think the new 2GB pricing plan for data with AT&T is an irritation, wait ?til you get a look at your bill with Verizon., I?ve founded and sold two software companies., All of my developers would rather work on MAC OS than any Windows OS machine., The government contractor I worked with replaced half their Dell Windows machines with Apple machines., Over the next year 97% of the IT support budget went to supporting the Windows machines., What does that tell you?, MG, I have both an apple ipod touch and a Droid Eris., I use them both for different things, because each has different strengths., My impression is that the Droid actually works much better as a phone., It has never dropped a call on me for any reason., It also works better as a data entry device because it has a swype keyboard, which is much much faster than hunting and pecking on the apple keyboard., It works better as a personal assistant because of its seamless integration with google calendar and google mail., It is more customizable ? the lack of top down control results in apps and widgets than can do more creative things with the hardware (things that Apple will not allow with their phone)., For all these reasons, I must respectfully disagree with your overgeneralizations claiming that Apple?s is somehow a superior device in every respect., My own experience has led me to believe otherwise., Apple is better for some reasons and Droid is better for others., And for the things that are important to me, Droid happens to be a better choice., I use an iPhone 3 and an iPhone 4 side by side ?about two weeks., Sometimes one phone gets better reception, sometimes the other does., Mostly it seems to depend on which tower they are getting the handshake from., I live in a high use area near DC and one tower or another will simply run out of bandwidth forcing the handshake to another tower further away., If I both are showing the same signal strength I know they are both connected to the same tower., Apart from all that, the iPhone 4 runs rings around the 3 and those of my friends that carry a Blackberry for work carry and iphone for personal use and the iPhone is clearly preferred by them (purchased with their own funds instead of their employer)., Since I am the employer and could choose any phone I wanted, I got the iPhone 4., Ahhaha, ?FaceTime technology?? something completely different from http://www.knowyourmobile.com/nokia/nokian95/nokian95userguides/2432/nokia_n95_video_calling.html from THREE YEARS AGO, the same year as the FIRST IPHONE, I assume?, Well, that?s probably truly revolutionaly, especially when you finally make your ?first FaceTime call?, oh my., Orgasms from the sheer thought, you know., I agree with @mtay ?

it can now shoot HD video at 720p resolution., Released alongside it is Apple's iMovie app, which lets you string your home movies together with titles and cross-fades, then export them to the device, to then be uploaded to YouTube or shared via email (and even MMS).Apple's unveiling of FaceTime at the iPhone 4 launch a few weeks ago provoked scoffs from some of its rivals, who rightly pointed out that video calls have been around for donkey's years, without anyone actually wanting to use them., Apple is betting that FaceTime's Wi-Fi-only nature ? which means better quality ? will win people over.It certainly works well, with a distinct lack of visual and/or audio distortion., You can switch between the front and rear cameras mid-call, too, to show off your current location., We're also impressed with the lack of setup, since it automatically detects if you're calling someone with an iPhone 4 and lets you switch to a FaceTime call.We're also big fans of Apple's iOS 4 software, although it's not exclusive to the iPhone 4., Multi-tasking, the ability to group your apps into folders and a unified inbox are all welcome improvements., As we said, you can get all this on an iPhone 3GS, but if you're planning to have apps multi-tasking in particular, iPhone 4's better battery life is a real boon.Talking of which..., The new handset is undoubtedly less of a juice-sapper than its predecessor, by which we mean it can comfortably get through a whole day's usage., It's not quite on the level of the iPad, but will certainly do nicely even for heavier app users.What we don't likeFaceTime works well, but it only works on the iPhone 4., If you're calling someone with a different iPhone model or another manufacturer's handset, you can't use it., What's more, there isn't yet a desktop app that supports FaceTime, so you can't videochat with people on a computer either.That means that some of the key potential usages - videochatting with your children when away on business, for example ? only work if you're a two-iPhone-4 family., Apple is aiming to change this, by making FaceTime a standard that any manufacturer can use in its products., It may launch a desktop FaceTime application, but in theory the technology could also be used by Nokia, Samsung, HTC or whoever., For now, FaceTime is a great feature whose potential is limited by the number of people using it.Meanwhile, the iPhone 4's external antenna design ? it's built into the stainless steel band which runs around the outside of the device ? has caused a big controversy since the handset went on sale last week., Bloggers and early buyers quickly discovered that when held in a certain way, the handset loses reception.It's undoubtedly embarrassing for Apple, which had hailed the new design as revolutionary., Claiming that the problem goes away when the iPhone 4 is inside a case or one of Apple's new 'bumpers' ? which it does ? is guaranteed to raise hackles among early adopters, given that those bumpers cost ?25 a pop.Two things may happen now., Apple could start bundling a free bumper with every iPhone 4 as a short-term measure., However, it's also been suggested that the problem might be fixed via a software update.We'd stress, though, that we've had no problems making or receiving voice calls, using connected apps or surfing the web on ours handset when holding the phone normally., We tested this using an iPhone 4 on both O2 and Vodafone., In any case, if you're one of the many people who kept their iPhone 3GS housed in a case, it won't be an issue at all if you follow suit with the iPhone 4.Finally, the geek in us wishes that Apple had followed Android's lead in providing a 'create your own hotspot' feature in iPhone 4 and/or the iOS 4 software., We'd love in particular to be able to tether the device wirelessly to an iPad to share its connection, rather than paying out for two separate tariffs.ConclusionEvery iPhone elicits strong reactions from the fanboys on one side and the detractors on the other., Picking your way between the hype and the hate, there's no doubt that iPhone 4 is a hugely impressive smartphone., It corrects key flaws in the previous model ? particularly the battery life ? and is one of the most user-friendly handsets when it comes to shooting hi-res video., The screen also sets new standards for smartphones., For now, it's king of the hill., SIM Free DealsPay As You Go DealsContract DealsReviewUser ReviewsSpecificationCompare

Physical Features
The iPhone 4 is thin and sharp., Apple has ditched the rounded, organic look of previous models for an almost Mid-Century Modern stainless steel band around two slabs of black glass., (All iPhone 4s available right now are black; a white model is coming soon, Apple says.) The result is a phone that's slightly smaller and noticeably thinner than all of its competitors, at 4.5-by-2.31-by-.37 inches., The device comes in two memory sizes, 16GB and 32GB., There's no memory card slot, and Apple cut down on the size of the SIM card slot., (Apple hates slots, because they mar the phone's lines.) They're using tiny "Micro-SIMs" now, which shouldn't bother you much if you're in the US; US users have no reason to ever remove the iPhone's SIM card., Most phones feel like gadgets, because they're all metal and plastic., The iPhone 4 feels like jewelry, because of all that glass., The front of the phone is nearly-indestructible Gorilla Glass, according to Apple, and the back is a different kind of tempered glass., That will make the phones relatively resistant to scratches, but I'd still recommend a case if you want to keep yours looking pristine., Apple's "retina screen" is pretty great, although it doesn't live up to its bombastic marketing copy., (What could?) The IPS LCD technology used has incredibly deep blacks and noticeably richer colors than the iPhone 3GS did, the viewing angles are wider, and it looks much better outdoors., It's far more beautiful than any other screen technology I've seen except for Samsung's upcoming Super AMOLED., I look forward to testing those two technologies against each other., The screen's 960-by-640 resolution is really important, but not for the reason you think., If your world consists only of Apple phones, the new resolution is a revelation., Text, especially, looks razor-sharp, and Web pages practically look like they were laser printed right onto your screen., TV shows and movies look much better on the iPhone 4 than on the iPhone 3GS ($99, )?you can see subtle details and richer colors., It's like switching from a standard-def to a high-def TV., But hold it next to a 3.5-inch, 800-by-480-or-greater screen like the ones on the HTC Droid Incredible ($299.99, ) or Motorola Droid ($249.99, ), and it's pretty hard to tell the difference unless you hold it really close and squint., Yes, the iPhone 4's text is sharper, but the other phones' displays are still readable down to the limit of my 10/15-with-glasses eyesight., The retina display leads the fight, but the battle has gone beyond the limits of human perception., The real reason for the retina display is to keep the iPhone's 225,000 apps running smoothly., By simply doubling the resolution from the iPhone's 320-by-480, Apple lets all the existing apps run without letterboxing or distortion., This is incredibly important; if Apple had changed the screen's aspect ratio, existing apps would have run with black bars across part of the screen., That's not a seamless Apple experience., Phone Calls and FaceTime Video Calls
The iPhone 4, like the 3GS, is a GSM/HSPA 7.2 phone that operates on AT&T's and foreign 3G bands., Also like previous iPhones, it's not the greatest phone for voice calling., Cue the screaming nay-sayers: "If it's not the world's best voice phone, what good is it?, A phone should be a PHONE!" Yes, that is a valid view., The iPhone 4 is not the phone for you., There are millions of people for whom making long, heartfelt voice calls isn't their primary desire?they send scads of text messages, play games, Fingerpoke on YouFace (if they're Tina Fey) and make brief voice calls to get their points across., The iPhone is for them., If you're looking for salvation from dropped calls, the iPhone 4 isn't it., In extremely weak signal conditions in our lab and our basement, the iPhone 3GS actually connected slightly more calls successfully than the iPhone 4 did?about one in ten additional calls went through., The iPhone 4 gave a truer picture of signal strength than the 3GS did, though; its "bar" meter is quicker to respond to changes in RF than the 3GS is., Apple also acknowledged that the "iPhone death grip" is real, and holding the phone the wrong way reduces signal strength., I made Speedtest.net data speed tests slow down and even stall out by picking up the phone and holding it in my left hand, with one finger on each seam of the phone and the bottom-left corner against the pad of a slightly sweaty palm., Putting the phone down on the table caused the speed test to resume., The death grip only made a difference on voice calls in weak signal conditions, though; with decent or strong signal, it didn't affect the iPhone's ability to connect calls., Adding one of Apple's $29 plastic "bumpers" fixed the death-grip issue entirely., The iPhone 4 does improve call quality once calls are connected., The earpiece is just excellent: sharp, clear and loud, without distortion or gain problems., The speakerphone, which seems to emanate from the lower back of the phone, is loud enough to use outdoors, and considerably louder than the 3GS's too-quiet unit., Transmissions sound strong if a little bit tinny on the other end; they're definitely less harsh than calls made from the 3GS., The iPhone 4 also stepped up noise cancellation with a dual-microphone setup, and it shows., While a little bit of background noise came through?the iPhone still isn't up to Motorola Droid X standards?the iPhone 4 cancelled background noise better than the 3GS and definitely well enough to muffle the sound of a refrigerated goods truck a few feet away from me., The iPhone's voice control is accurate, extensive, and worked with our Aliph Jawbone Icon ($199-$99, ) Bluetooth headset perfectly, including triggering voice dialing from the headset., Along with dialing numbers, you can control the iPod functions from the headset, which is really neat., I wasn't able to get a full battery test done in time for this review, so I'll update the review when I can., But battery life looks on par with most other major smartphones?about a day of average use., FaceTime, Apple's video calling system, is a gimmick for now., Remember when you could only send text messages to someone with the same wireless carrier?, FaceTime is even more limited: your friend has to have the same model of phone, and you both have to be in Wi-Fi hotspots, and you have to remember to turn on your Wi-Fi., That makes FaceTime a special-occasion parlor trick rather than a general purpose solution., When you do get all the ducks in a row, it works., My FaceTime call was clear; my own face appeared in a small window in the upper left hand corner of the screen, while the person I was calling took up the whole screen., You can talk through the speakerphone or a Bluetooth headset, and you can flip the view around to use the rear camera and show your correspondent what you're seeing?though I found the image became pixelated very quickly when using the rear camera., That said, I got FaceTime to work on the first try, which is a lot more than I can say for Fring and Qik on Android., Mobile video calling in the US is clearly not ready for prime (face) time yet, but a desktop or Android FaceTime client coming in the next year could really change the situation by giving iPhone owners more people to call.?Next: Smartphone and App Experience >, God I hate Apple fanboys., The article was fine until the last section., "a strong rivalry between iPhone and Android is a good thing for us all" 
I agree!, For iPhone and Android lovers, competition between the two will keep Android & iOS on its feet., If Android comes up with a new feature, iPhone will have it as well..maybe make it better., If iPhone comes out with something unique?Android will copy it as well., Competition will keep, prices low, us happy with new tech and every few months a new Android will on sale and every new year a new iPhone will have new cool features., Competition will keep all Apple & Android Fanboys Happy., "Once I had an iPhone 3GS and went back to using an iPhone 3G, the latter almost seemed unusable to me., Thanks to the screen on the iPhone 4, this seems likely to be the case as well." 
But that wasn't the case when you went back to the iPhone 3G from the EVO?, Interesting, as the EVO's OLED screen is not any worse than the iPhone 4's LCD, marketing BS aside., I really like the look n feel of this new iphone 4, apple thumbs up to you., keep it up  http://www.videocrux.com/video/25540/Apple-unveil?, Jesus do you have NOTHING better to do?, I'm very excited to get my hands on one of these., Did you not read the first  and second paragraphs?, He?s writing from the perspective of an iPhone lover., That was your fair warning., Man I can?t wait for the *jizzedinmypants* iPhone 4., I love the smile you gave when you first saw yourself on the front facing camera!, Like ?Oh yeah, finally!?, I don?t get the comments about pricing., Specifically, so what if the iPhone was sold by another carrier?, Don?t other carriers do phone subsidies as well?, Verizon might not give Apple as much money, but I?d think selling several million additional phones to Verizon customers might offset that nicely., I applaud Apple for its innovation in design, though think it odd that a gyroscope is a Keynote-worthy feature., Apple drives other companies to produce better-looking devices, which is awesome., And they lead in many ways when it comes to design., That said, I find switching back to an iphone/ipod touch from my incredible to be slow and counter-intuitive., (from the bberry it was more just awkward) 
As someone who?s mostly on the sidelines for this, I was pretty relieved with this release., I have no regret purchasing the incredible a few weeks ago, given I use a phone to you know, talk to people., (I also wonder if wifi chat was somehow spurned on by the dismal performance of AT&T), But the prices really aren't LOW., It's over $200 for crying out loud!!, We've just been conditioned to pay high prices and think it's a bargain., Some probably has done the math (other than Apple and AT&T) on how much money they are making on us poor saps who simply love the iPhone., "I keep coming back to that when thinking about iPhone vs., Android., For a long time, iPhone felt like a Lexus while Android was more like a Kia., With recent upgrades, Android has transformed into more of a Honda., But with iPhone 4, the iPhone is now an Aston Martin." 
That's kind of a horrible analogy., Kia cars these days just have the quality stigma, but the Kia Forte routinely rivals and in some cases outscores the Civic in car reviews and scores., Generally people who know next to nothing about cars lay judgments about Kia based on their reputation back in the 1990s., Only problem is it's been about 20 years since then., But admittedly Google is for the most part playing catchup., Their UI continues to improve., However, I disagree with you when you say that Google plus the hardware manufacturers will never close the gap., The fact is they have been closing very quickly and they've really only just begun., For every single iPhone that Apple releases, there will be twenty or thirty phones from HTC, Motorola, Samsung, LG, etc., combined released., Some of these will surpass the iPhone's hardware., Some UI polish and Google has closed the gap too., At this point, I think Apple's restrictive mentality will start to bite., The question will then be 'Should I get an iPhone or an equivalent that has HDMI, USB, expandable memory, replaceable battery, the choice to run whatever I want including Flash, etc.?'., I thought that was weird too., Here in australia you can get a new iphone for free from five different carriers as long as you sign onto a 2 year plan., Most of those plans start at $60 per month for calls plus data (or cheaper plans are around if you wanna contribute to the cost of the handset)., Man, you're posting in a wankin-loving Apple forum, what did you expect?., The Nexus One already has a screen that's better than the Iphone 3gs, but no one seem to notice until uncle jobs decided to put a decent one on the iPhone., And the cpu?, well, the iPhone was the crappiest one ever., I had a 2g, a 3gs, and now a Nexus One, and I won't go back to the megalomaniac phone, ever!., This was probably written a month ago and was just waiting until he could actually hit "submit"., Even conceding that it?s an aston martin, it?s an aston martin that only comes with an automatic transmission and that everyone, including soccer moms, are driving around., This is damn impressive, yes, because the reason everyone?s got one, as you point out, is that it?s priced like a Honda., You can also only fill it up at BP with low grade fuel though., Android isn?t a single car., It's a half an inch with bigger, with almost a quarter less resolution?, The screen qualities aren't even close., Breaking news!, Apple's biggest fan boy loves the iPhone 4!, This article is not necessary., Everyone knows that even if the iPhone 4 was literally a turd in a box, you would still love it more than Android because it has Apple's name on it., I agree it's a great upgrade for the iPhone hardware, and thank heavens they went back to a flat back, but seriously ? 99.9999% of TC readers could have predicted everything you wrote in this article., I just don't see the point., If iPhone is Aston Martin then Android is The A-Team's bitchin' van, whatever helicopter that Murdock managed to commandeer, and god-knows-what battle armored jalopy can be assembled inside of a ridiculously fully stocked warehouse with a ridiculously poorly constructed door on the front., Android is every possibility ? when a plan comes together., All I read in this article is blah blah blah., In my personal preference I tend to disagree with the article in many ways but looking at strictly from a technical point of view, It's nothing special to set itself aprt and not the best phone on the market?near the top for sure, but not the king., Being with AT&T alone in itself is a HUGE negative and throw in the rediculous data plans they recently introduced, you won't even be able to use the phone much for its intended purpose without attached to wi-fi., The idea of them limited video calls to other iPhones is obsurd and another example of Apple telling you what you can do with YOUR phone., Video editing is more a feature bullet than fully functional usable feature?it's 3.5" of screen!, The battery life is its best feature and a nice one at that, however they have to have that has once again, you can't remove the battery., oh and before i forget, it's still tied to iTunes?-1, I have always depended on TechCrunch for insightful objective reviews of the very latest tech news., I have enjoyed many postings by all of its writers and guest writers., But to continue to allow incredibly biased, non-objective reviews of Apple hardware and software by MG discredits TechCrunch's reputation and merely makes you a PR amplifier for the Cupertino Empire., He hides behind the "I'm an avid fan" caveat and would like to think his Apple-related postings remain objective., This is like Hitler describing the German perspective of that "minor skirmish" and sound "ethnic policies," but prefacing it with a "BTW, I sorta was in charge of it all?" note and expecting all readers to think "Oh, that's ok then." I'm sure he feels his fanboy proclamations are kind of humorous as well as those who appreciate his biased Apple postings, but it completely discredits his non-Apple postings (which I think are noteworthy) as well as TechCrunch's reputation., BTW, I am a 3GS owner and have been very loyal to Apple, but I guess an Aston Martin isn't just appealing to me anymore., All I want is a dependable PHONE that charges for it's true value and not the 99,900+ apps that I'll never need or use, but others will claim are proof of it's superiority., Have you ever noticed that Apple or it's users have never once said, "It's an awesome PHONE?" or "Crystal clear calls?" Why have you never mentioned that MG?, I guess that will be in the iPhone 7 with its "Canine Auditory Speaker and Microphone" that will reproduce frequencies that only dogs can hear., Michael, please do not allow MG to continue to write incredibly biased PR for Apple under the TechCrunch moniker., I know it's difficult, but so was exposing Scamville?., If you have to tell 500 people to turn off their phones to use your wifi, they blew it, ?you do realize the EVO doesn't have an OLED screen, right?, Perhaps more importantly, these are mobile devices, and OLED is really not very good for such applications because it lacks the brightness to compete with direct sunlight., I now how it feels ? I had the same feeling 5 years ago on my crappy Sony Ericsson Z610i., I do not disagree with you, but from a developers perspective I find it difficult to develop for all the known devices that the Droid OS may appear on., It's why I enjoy locked down hardware since I only have to code for a small subset of devices, but please do not take this the wrong way and see it for a reason to cause another argument in comments., TechCrunch has enough of those., I'm writing from the perspective of a nazi., it's ok to say  that since i stated I was a nazi., I could charitably be described as an Android fanboy., I hate Apple's gestapo policy with editorializing and censoring apps they don't agree with, I can't fathom using a phone that handles notifications so., poorly, and I love that Android lets me basically install an app to fix the things I don't like about it, instead of hoping it'll come around in a couple of years on a new phone., (A perfect example is the stock SMS client on vanilla Android., Handcent really takes care of most of those problems.) 
That said, the iPhone 4 hardware looks absolutely delightful to hold., One of my friends is an Apple fanboy who will order it as soon as preorder drops, so I'm sure I'll get to hold one and play with it a bit., HTC is doing a great job spooling up their design teams, and I'm thrilled with my Nexus One, but the iPhone hardware does seem to have some real neat fit-and-finish components to make people ooh and ahh a bit more., Can't wait to see what comes out on the Android side to match/best., Doesn't EVO have an LCD screen?, The comparison between the iPhone and a car or anything has one big problem, it may not be the easiest thing todo but you are FREE to choose to have sex in an Aston Martin., I love Apple design but policies and "parenting" adults is and should be a deal breaker for any free spirit., Problem with the comments on the debate is ppl comment without first trying the device., So wait out until you get a hand on it., When iPad came out, i read so much negative press about it initially., After debating for two weeks, went to store finally to play with it, and was amazed by the experience.it was quick 10 min decision to buy it., All the negative talk about it does not have this, it does not have I found it meaningless., I just dont need the whole world in it., Of course, it depends on your use case., MG, you got the right metaphor, cars, but you chose the wrong makes., Android is like a Mercedes (EVO)., And a ? 
In other words, the iPhone has only high end devices., With the Android you'll see a race to the bottom., By the end of this year you'll see Androids for less $150 with no contract., By the end of next year they'll be $50., You'd think that apple wouldn't care since they're happy to create quality devices where they control the full experience., Once the number of IOS devices becomes a fraction of the number of Android devices, the developers will migrate in mass away from the Apple walled garden., Once that happens, IOS will become a secondary platform, and we've all seen this movie., It's the Mac against the PC all over again., IOS will be 5%-10% of the market with dedicated followers, you'll hear IOS fans howel that the press hates them and that company X sucks because their software doesn't run as fast on IOS as it does on Android., the evo has a tft lcd display not oled, but its still nice ;) i guess haha., The whole FaceTalk thing will fail miserably, it's such a niche feature especially with it only working on wifi right now., The fact is a lot people (particularly in certain cultures) don't like having a camera or someone their speaking to really close to their face, and as it's a mobile phone it's only going to be at arms-length away., Can you imagine holding the phone in that position and having a normal conversation with someone?, My girlfriend uses Skype with a webcam on her netbook to speak to her parents, which is far more natural as she can sit it on her lap and talk away., I have an iPhone 3GS but I'm not paying a load more for a nicer screen and a better camera, especially as the camera should have been much better a long time ago., I really believe that Apple should give people the choice to run Flash if they so wish., A dictatorship is never fair., And until Apple's mentality is adjusted, Andriod becomes more appealing by the day., It's strange how you always compare the subsidized prices instead of the actual prices and point out how cheap iPhone is., Do you think you don't pay for the hardware in your phonebill?, Here the lowest price for Nexus One (for example) is 540? and the lowest price for iPhone 3GS 16Gb is 720?., You can buy your iPhone subsidized but you can't get an uncapped dataplan if you do., The best plan with 1Gb cap (drops to 64kbit/s after that, or buy additional 1Gb for 50%) is about 90? a month but the good news is that the phone is only 23? (24month contract)., And you get 1000mins and 1000 SMSs as well., How cheap is that!, Of course, if you want unlimited, uncapped mobile broadband (up to 15Mbit/s, no transfer limit) you'd have to pay as much as 13,90? a month for that plus whatever package you wanted (3000mins + 3000 SMSs = 45?/month for example) plus what ever Android phone you wanted., If you want subzidized Android you could try HTC Legend, 24 month contract, 3000 mins + 3000 SMSs + unlimited, uncapped data is about 64? a month., I think I can spot a difference, Correction: iPhone is an Aston-Martin, but you can't drive it into the red light district (porn), into amusement parks (flash), and it randomly refuses to go certain places that Aston-Martin hasn't deemed "acceptable"; Android is a Honda that you can drive wherever the hell you want., @reviewer: funny how Apple fanbois only talk about the hardware and the software, not about the "Apple Monetized Playpen" aspect., Do you think your article is complete ?, I know the end user experience of the speed may be the same to the 3gs, but keep in mind it's pushing 4x the pixel data., The point is, the average users will never ask for an Android phone!, They will rather ask for "the nice handset from Motorola/HTC which was released last week"., I guess that was fine with Google as long as an android based phone is sold., No single phone beats iPhone now and less likely in near future., Regarding "Should I get an iPhone or an equivalent that has HDMI, USB?.", people just don't consider any single phone equivalent to iPhone., And unfortunately there is something called perception which is very hard to alter., It will take years of effort to alter people's perception towards iPhone., Most of the people still feel proud to get their hand on iPhone., Thee major difficulty Android will face because of the fragmentation., There will be some very good Android but there will be some "not so good Android"., So it will be difficult for Android to build an uniform user experience which will build positive perception., What's so bad of being a fan of a good thing?, Writing from the perspective of an iPhone lover is an absolutely worthless perspective., I can't wait to hear Palin's assessment of Obama, oh boy!, *wink* *smile* 
It's filled with joyful phrases like "Apple continues to improve their hardware/software combination at a rate that it?s not clear that Google (and their OEM partners) will be able to match."  Looking over the last 12 months, looking at what IO had to say versus WWDC, I'd say that Google has surpassed Apple with the pace hardware/software evolution., The whole thing regarding Honda and Aston Martin is just unfounded dreck., So Apple finally has the better screen., For how long have they had the lesser screen?, How long is it until Android devices adopt something similar?, There's only a handful of companies in the world with this class of TFT technology, and most of those happen to manufacture Android devices too., Maybe had WWDC given us some daringly new announcements, my view would be different., But Apple came out with nothing that wasn't already preannounced on Gizmodo., I'm sure you can go to any place where there are a few hundred people using wifi and expect excellent connection., That comment has no merit., Could happen to anyone, even Google., I think that the latest Android phones were (are) consistently better that the 3GS., Every assessable factor (radio, camera, display, expandibility, "horsepower", ?) says so, except for people like MG keeping objecting "no, iPhone 3G is still the best" with no real arguments., Now, iPhone 4 is a _big_ improve on 3GS, and I'd say that it clearly stands out of competition., Obvious weak points of 3GS have been addressed, and strong points improved beyond the reach of any competitor., The iPhone 4 will be a huge success, possibly more than the iPad (which I don't expect to keep the sales pace of its launch), and I am prepared to see dozens of them around my workplace very soon., If I could afford one, I would get it myself., This does not mean that Android phones will not close the gap., Android is, very simply, a better software platform from an architectural point of view, it improves faster, it can leverage a wider range of vendors., It will take the combined skills of Google and HTC, and possibly other third parties, to match Apple capability to innovate, but they will catch up, and before 2011 begins we will see some new device, better than iPhone 4., And, as MG notes, that's great for users., Returning evo., It's awkward in size and use., The whole android experience feels like the kludgy pc environment., Too many comprises., you ppl act like a phone is the be it and end of your lives .., go get a life guys .., after all these are just phones .., they should first concentrate on improvinf the calling features without interruption , then concentrate about adding smart phone abilities .., go get a life ppl.., I don't understand why people are still going over the Flash debate., Hasn't been on the devices for two years and there is no clear indication of it ever., Seems like a closed case no matter how many people push it., Both sides have their own points, but it is ultimately up to the consumer, you, whether the product is bought., People are still buying so Apple sees no reason to change., Only way to change is to make them realize the market is suffering without it and only way to do that is to buy the alternative., So if you need Flash then go for Android and show Apple how you feel., As the consumer you ultimately have the decision making process in products, but that power only comes when enough decide it is time to acquire it., Everybody is entitled to their opinion which you have demonstrated by your comment, but if you do not like it, you do not have to read TechCruch., There are other blogs ., Who's talking about Google?, I'm talking about this particular device not being able to use wifi when there's a few hundred people around., Ex., Well, at least we're seeing the 2 sides of the coin., Although, some of us here are on the neutral side., To think that each phones will have some problems one way or another and in case you don't like it., You just need to switch off to a new phone., I like the iPhone 4 announcement yesterday, although the real shocker for me wasn't the video-conferencing feature ? But rather its 10 hours 'on wifi' battery., Obviously, Android has an answer for that in the coming months., That's news to me?, I bought mine outright from Vodafone and just use pre-paid on it, so thats an option as well, You have to concede that the opposite is true also, if the iPhone was apple to control the weather and bring about world peace, Android lovers would still be banging on about fanboys and soccer moms and about people only wanted Apple products for the social status (without a hint of irony), Your major arguments there are about the carriers data plans and Steve Jobs business model (strict controls over the iTunes/iOS ecosystem), so not "strictly from a technical point of view", i'm not saying your not entitled to your opinion but it is from an emotional point of view., No offence but you are just the same as every other cliche Apple haters, anyone who disagrees with your point of view is biased or like hitler (thanks for invoking Godwins law of Nazi analogies there too!), he HAS to preface his article by saying he is an iPhone lover for this very reason, because you can't believe any article that supports Apple to be objective, You can have sex on an iPhone, FFS journalism means you have to be neutral!, Giving a heading as a warning and going on with fanboy ranting does not justify it., Please be a journalist thats what you are paid for and go join a course or something to learn what journalism means., If a New York Times journalist gave a heading "Republican lovers thought/take "etc., He would be fired that very moment., How the f*** is this getting through., The flash thing is done with now, it is what it is, Obviously the number of Android devices will dwarf the number if iOS devices, if you throw enough mud at a wall a lot of it is going to stick, You don't have to use FaceTalk though, i can't see how it can fail miserably if no-one wants to use it it will just sit on the phone unused like the iPod does on my iPhone because I don't listen to any music on it., Not criticising the new iPhone ? it looks like a nice bit of kit, but saying it's way ahead of everything else?, Yeah, it's got a better screen res (but that will soon be caught up with), and some nice stuff in, but I can't help but think, with a lot of the changes, "well done Apple, you've given your users what the rest of us have had for a while now" ? multitasking, front camera, 5MP back camera, etc., Surely this was the phone they could and should have release a year ago to stay ahead of the competition rather than trailing behind it?, Luckily the iPhone has a feature called 'Safari' for those trips into the red light districts, Wow, where do you live where there are 500+ wifi stations in the same area as the hall?, They generally don't care?, its more the Android fanboys who are upset by the app ecosystem, i guess i can only speak for this fanboy (myself) but i'm not so naive to think that apple aren't make money from their platform., Google (thats who makes Android) makes money from Ads, Apple makes money from Apps., As if Android fanboiis were any even TINY bit better., This is true in UI, but when you are talking about Apple policies, AT&T service, and hardware specs, your statement doesn't hold true., of which goes beyond what the human eye can recognize so it all goes to waste which equates to well?not much, aside from further correcting that Android is certainly more of a Mercedes than a Honda (although it can be that too and lots of other brands) ? this is exactly what I was going to say as well., So you have that nice-looking "car" and look what it *won't* let you do even if you really want to? kinda sucks, doesn't it?, They are simply not going to choose a radio standard other than GSM., CDMA is a technology that is in its autumn., Not going to happen., Despite all the bickering between Android and Apple and the Adobe flash war I think that the new iPhone is a stunning piece of kit that is well beyond the competitions offerings., Yeah the concepts of forward facing cameras, video chat and multitasking is not neccessarily new, but what they have done is bring them all into one package., Adn the added tech of the screen and talk time/battery life, design a build construction just sets the new iPhone worlds apart from any Android offering., All I know is that as soon as it becomes available in the UK I'll be getting one, especially as the primary carrier, O2, are going to be offering a limited upgrade option to existing customers!!, And what's wrong with Toyota's?, They produce some of the worlds most versatile range of cars, or they used to anyway?plus they own lexus which as recently developed the LFA, an Aston Martin eating beast!!!!, Decent article, and then it all went to s**t with that last section., The inner fanboy leaked all over the floor., It strikes me that, whether MG is genuine iPhone lover, or he is intentionally subjective just for controversy ? techcrunch wins: lots of comments from both sides, lots of traffic?
Doesn't look much like genuine journalism to me anyway?, You make absolutely no sense, he is giving an opinion piece review from his type of standpoint., Unlike your biased hatred for anything MG writes, I for one particularly benefit from these pieces because he is able to clearly illustrate the differences in both iOS and Android., Another thing if you think the New York Times never has any type of biased reporting, you have literally been living under a rock., It is rare for any reporter these days to completely remove their view from their writing, especially as they have to fight off bloggers for the eyeballs of the masses., I fail to see how the iPhone 4 has improved the hardware apart from the screen resolution., The newer Android devices are still better than the iPhone 4 for all the same reasons that they are better than the 3GS., And I'd like someone who has seen and used both to comment on how the iPhone 4's display compares to the Super OLED on the Samsung Galaxy S., I can't make out the difference from screen shots and video., Exactly my opinion., It's a good upgrade for Apple., As far as compared to the competition, not so much., Japan/Korea has had these form factor phones for years sigh? nothing new here, The iPhone 4 is so schweet that I may not be able to wait any longer for the iPhone to come to Verizon., By the way, do you really think they will call it the iPhone 5 next year?, I think there is a good chance that it will get a moniker of iPhone 4G., no flash, grow up apple.., WWDC was a great opportunity for Apple to (re)establish its leadership position, but for WWDC was a lost opportunity for Apple., In fact, it is still catching up with Android in certain features., "If Android comes up with a new feature, iPhone will have it as well..maybe make it better., If iPhone comes out with something unique?Android will copy it as well." Seriously?, Paraphrase: If Google comes up with something Apple will make it Magical., If Apple makes something magical Google will copy it for the muggles., I'm guessing you've got an iPhone in your pocket., BTW: Those new features on the iPhone 4, the front facing camera and noise canceling second microphone aren't new., They're cool features Apple copied from its competitors., I will wait to buy the iPhone 7 when will actually be able to use FaceTime anywhere, not just in wifi., I mean this is a mobile phone right?, If I am near wifi it probably means I am near my laptop, which means I am near my Skype, which all my family members have., every hipster, poser, dbag has or wants one., It's great for what it is, an energy efficient, me2 car that works reliably and something anyone can drive, from your girlfriend to your grandma., Stick shift, RWD, massive amounts of power, your girlfriend and grandma wouldn't be able to drive it, anyone that actually KNOWS cars are envious., Anyone that owns one laughs whenever prius drivers yap about their econoboxes., It's not a great device, it still can't run 2.2 and the battery life is laughable., I suspect Siegler has never driven an Aston Martin., We're better because we have better phones :-P, "But Apple came out with nothing that wasn't already preannounced on Gizmodo" 
Um, iMovie for iPhone was a pretty cool announcement., In fact it was so cool 10 years ago on the Mac that MS was forced to add the anemic "Movie Maker" to their XP OS just to keep their sheep happy., And, as has been the case since I started using Apple products in 1983, Apple will continue to force other companies to follow suit as they have with the Mac, the mass adoption of USB, the introduction of consumer WiFi, the iPod, the iPad, the iPhone?when Google does something legitimately new that Apple hasn't done yet, I'll be impressed., I wonder if at some point we will get access to the file system., But the phone looks so good!, I wonder if this is yet another disposable Mac throw-away? My 3G iphone has been slowly falling apart since I bought it., Everybody raves about Apple devices, but nobody questions the annoying tendency they have to start failing after a surprisingly short time., I see it with iPhones, and I really see it with Mac laptops., You cant trade quality for cool forever., Thing is, for me,no matter how great the hardware build is, it will just feel a like a toy for me, I am a iPhone developer, the OS is the problem., For me, using an iPhone is like going back to a dumb phone, I feel like I have moved backwards., Android is just a different type of device, one that makes me feel like Im actually using a mobile pc and not a just a phone., I call this the beginning of the end for Apple dominance in the smartphone space!, Suppose you are the type that falls into the category that likes things dictated to you, I fall into the category that likes to have choice?, Like it or not there *are* lots of people who feel the same way as MG about the iPhone vs Android, that if you don't care about techie issues like openness and on-paper specs then the iPhone is simply the best experience., It is a useful contribution to get the reaction of someone who thinks the way I do., I want it., MG,
I think you jumped the gun a bit on iPhone pricing., In real terms, before subsidy, the price of the iPhone used to be $500/$600/$700 for the last 12 months, and we seriously don't know what it's going to be now., AT&T, while keeping the iPhone's subsidized price at the same point, just announced a significant price drop for their plans of $5 to $15 per month (that $120 to $360 over 2 years, even if the geeks are unable to see that), so it's not clear at all if the iPhone subsidy might have to come down and if, as of now, Android phones will also have to make do with lower subsidies than before, both on AT&T and on the other networks, as the market follows AT&T's lead in terms of cheaper data plans and then passes the pressure on to manufacturers., We will have to see how international iPhone prices look like: If plans and/or the iPhone get cheaper in France, Germany and the UK, and what the unsubsidized iPhones sold by Apple in Italy and Hong Kong are going to cost, and we'll have to listen to Apple's quarterly report in April and October to hear about their ASP., Then we can talk about the real price of the iPhone 4., My hunch is that it might be at least $100 cheaper: $400 for the iPhone 3GS and $500/$600 for the iPhone 4., It was always clear that Apple had ample, almost excessive margins in the 3GS, and now, with more heat coming from Android, and with Apple producing their own CPU (=higer fixed cost but lower variable cost), they might finally pull the trigger on iPhone prices., But it's certainly too soon to judge., Yes, Windows Movie Maker, a program that no one has ever used or wanted., Another piece of Windows bloat, thanks Apple., Yes, the Mac niche was responsible for the mass adoption of USB and Wifi., By adopting USB, it forced others to comply., Your problem is that you define "legitimately new" as Apple only., This post was fine until the end., But your fanboy shows whenever you try to minimize Android., You say you were "beyond impressed" by Android 2.2., So you were "beyond impressed" by a Honda?, Doubtful., You're minimizing Android for the sake of keeping the iPhone a safe distance away (in your mind) and not giving it its due., If your biggest thing is looks, iPhone wins hands-down on sex appeal., Personally, I care most about battery life, so iPhone wins on that score as well., But a close second to battery life is POWER., That word can mean different things to different people, but top Android phones are more powerful devices by almost any measurement., There is literally not a single thing an iPhone can do that an Android phone can't., But there's a laundry list of things that Android has over iPhone., You minimizing the importance of that is like an Android stan minimizing the importance of the App Store in this equation., And Android can't keep pace with Apple's hardware/software development?, It's a hell of a good one, but Android drops dozens of phones a year with more software updates and they're all only getting better., That pace of iteration will literally drown the iPhone this year or next., Technologically, Android has leapt past iPhone with 2.2., You're probably one of a dwindling number of tech bloggers who disagrees., But I can't wait to see your rationalizing at work in the winter when Gingerbread drops., Safari) has lots of naked ladies., "But the crazy thing is that the iPhone is an Aston Martin with a Honda-price., Meanwhile, Android remains a Honda at a Honda-price ? it?s a good deal, but it?s not an iPhone-deal." 
No., The fandroid lost, I wouldn't say a Prius, because the iphone is beautiful., I'd say it's more like., They are both GT3s, though the iPhone is an RS., It just has an automatic, and you can't get rid of it., Well said !, heheh, your kinda made a bit of an arse of yourself there Martin., The problem was there were far too many wifi access point type devices saturating the frequencies, things like portable wifi adapters converting cell to wifi hot spots etc
Take a look at your own wifi access point / router, bet you only have about 12 channels to set!, Most people leave them on the default setting too!, Jees, even at home, it often pays to move your wifi channel away from the default setting if you can see several other wifi networks in your reception area!, Nice., I'd rather say "mid-winter", Yes, but the realities of the business model have very real effects on what you can do with your technology., So it's not theoretically a "technical" point of view, but pragmatically, it certainly is., There is NOTHING revolutionary about the new iphone., Every believed that iphone 4 would be revolutionary and now the Apple fanboys are claiming iphone 5 will be revolutionary, iphone fanboys are the most brainwashed people out there, I used to be one but have seen the Android goodness., Iphones are now for your granny, soccer mums and anyone who wants to feel cool but doesn't really understand what they are doing., Iphone is the smartphone that appeals because you DONT have to be smart to use it., The new screen may be impressive but not much else imo and why is it still kept to a minature size, if any fan boys aree totally honest with themselves they will admit that its pointless watching a movie on such a tiny screen, FACT., There is nothing in OS4 that Android cant do, and thats a FACT., The frightening thing for Apple is that they spend an absolute fortune marketing their products while in Europe Google doesn't spend anything on promoting Android, can you imagine how many extra sales Android would make if they actually marketed to the masses., I used to love Apple, but never again., Owned the Evo for a few days and did really enjoy it, but all the tweaking I was doing to preserve battery life was seriously uncool so I returned it., The HTC Sense overlay was cool and man am I going to miss the wifi hotspot feature, but I do need a reliable (I am speaking about power here) portable smartphone device., 3gs was my first iPhone and have to say I do love it so I will get the new one., I work on iMac at work but Windows 7 is my preferred OS at home., Mac OS is too utilitarian for my personal computing needs but I like that to be the case on my phone., Still, Android is banging on the door., And I will look again in the future., To me it?s not about supporting the brand?it?s about the brand supporting me!, dream on fanboy ;) 
there is a big dog in Town and it is called ANDROID., you will have to live with that from now on., your new toy that you are trying relentlessly to portray as revolutionary is merely implementing features that existed on ANDROID sets for more than a year., and i think people came to know the tricks used by Apple fanatics by now, every time they get iPawned, they start using general global unspecific generic unquantifiable words to describe their devices., like "the Evo has better hardware but the iPhone still gives a better experience"
or "ANDROID has better features technically but lacks the polish of the iPhone"
or "this device is magical" 
guys, get over it, those kind of tricks work only on Apple forums, and it may be shocking for you but smart people exist !, Flash runs like a dead turtle on mobile devices., What is the issue with everyone wanting flash?, iPhone 3gs is going to get ios4 before the new model is even released., I pre-ordered the android g1, had the cliq, my touch and Nexus one., Loved android until I got the 3gs., EVERY issue I had with android was fixed on the 3gs., Got tired of root, reflashing, and cooking roms to get a ?better? phone., iPhone just works and 200 bux is cheap for a product that works!, Was really nice to watch your little demo video with my froyo-powered-flash-enabled nexus one., A great article and I can?t wait together my hands on one., That said many of my friends will not get one because they think Apple are out to make as much money as possible by releasing only one phone per year., I have said that all companies need revenue to expand and create more for us to want., I mean Microsoft is a big example of this by releasing thier os every couple of years at huge prices., They also feel that Apple are not including as much of the new tech out there as they could ie better cameras , USB ports and expandable memory are just a few I can think of., But as long as I am a gadget freak and love the iPhone I will get one., But I might just wait to get my next iPhone until 2012 after I get the iPhone 4., Can?t wait, Just for the sake of this article, I?ll pretend that I?m a Aston Martin hater to put my love for Froyo and beyond., It sums up., "I hate Apple's gestapo policy?"
Congratulations? making your post irrelevant (and moronic) via invocation of Nazis in the first line is a new record., True mate and similar to what I also wrote., The sad thing is that the Apple fanboys are the most brainwashed people on the planet., When someone is brainwashed they will believe anything, enter Dictator Jobs and his marketing salvo., Actually I owned a iPhone for almost 1 year, then last year I switched to the Motorola Droid., The last few months Ive had the HTC Incredible and love it., Face it? the big gripe from Android boys is the inability download porn., Must be lonely in their parents basement., Not if they insist on including Flash., so basically according to the Apple fanboy: 
- a Honda can do 4G while Aston martin cant !, - a Honda has turn by turn navigation while the Aston martin doesnt., - a Honda has a web browser faster than the Aston martin's
- a Honda can Do Flash while Aston martin cant
- a Honda had a larger resolution 1 year before Aston martin got it
- a Honda could multi task years before the Aston martin
- a Honda can be customized while the Aston martin can not 
yeah right :) very interesting analogy., in that case, ill take the Honda over your Aston martin., but in reality, the new iPhone compared to the Evo 4G and the iOS compared to FroYo sounds more like the iPhone package is a Toyota Pryus trying to compete with Ferrari and McLaren F1s., also, Aston martin should probably sue you for associating their name with an inferior product, and making them sound like they are a goofed up hyped product for dumb people who cant read specs., Do you spew the same garbage about articles written by your Apple-hating kindred?, You're kidding, right?, You need a Morse Code transmitter too?, As for Flash (the major vector for porn, childish games, and annoying ads) I think its not Apple who needs to 'grow up'., FaceTime is a proof of concept? a 'this is how to do it right' example., APIs to the cameras will obviously allow Skype to implement the feature right quick., Relax., Returning evo, yeah ? again from someone who has yet to see the actual device., no, it doesn't., "Interesting, as the EVO's OLED screen is not any worse than the iPhone 4's LCD, marketing BS aside." 
1) EVO doesn't have an OLED screen., 2) Have you seen the iPhone 4's screen yet?, Can someone at WWDC find out whether the new iPhone 4 will: 
1.) allow you to change the focus points while shooting video, or do you have to commit before shooting?, 2.) support monitor out for external monitors?, It seems all the iPhones in the demos during the keynote were using a regular connector., The iphone remains the iphone hardware software combination remains the winning solution???for now., Well, in Indonesia iPhone is priced at $600-$1100? and still requires a one year contract., So it is Aston Martin there., Damn you Telkomsel!, maybe, but remember that at first apple was selling the thing for $600 ? then cut it to $400., it was only after at&t did the huge upfront payment that it went to $200., i think it would be hard for apple to justify making less per phone sold now., Htc evo hd video is only 24 fps compared to 30 fps of iphone., well, not only Android and Google, he insulted Honda to the best, like this?, it's a good point., I think it all depends on what users are looking for., I, for one, consider e-mail service the most important thing., Consequently, I own a BlackBerry., Neither iOS nor Android can match BlackBerry on that department., If I were focusing on media stuff, I would probably be considering Android since it is far more versatile than iOS., If seamless app functionality were my main interest, I would seriously consider iOS., Then again, it is all up to user's needs, choices and preferences., By the way, I am very happy with BlackBerry., where's your disclosure that you're an android fanboy?, line breaks, try em., "Iphone is the smartphone that appeals because you DONT have to be smart to use it., " 
This is a bad thing?, MG?Rather than the Aston Martin comparison, how about the Ferrari FXX, which isn't street legal?, Great to have in your garage, but sucks that it won't work anywhere., I disagree that outsourced hardware will *necessarily* lead to improvement or market success., For every Mac Apple puts out, there are at least 20 Dell/HP/Lenovo/Sony/Acer models in the same premium price range, often with better featurelists and specs., *Apple still sells %91 of the PC's over $1,000!, (NPD statistic)*  More to the point, while there are some solid competitors, the competition is uneven ? sometimes Sony releases a stinker, companies put out quirky designs that fail., With Apple, more often than not, there's reassurance  in getting a familiar design that's been painstakingly refined over the course of years rather than slapped together by an OEM., They do a major redesign once every 3-5 years and are not suffering in terms of profitability? 
I wonder if we're moving into this terrain with smartphones., If Apple's really raised the bar in quality and feel, it's not something that the "HTC Awesome Droid 5" can negate in a product cycle or two by slapping a new chip and screen together., That is an extremely unfair analogy., I get that the Aston Martin comparison equates the iPhone to being luxurious, highest quality, etc etc, while juxtaposing it next to a Honda illustrates the cheap cost., But then to say Android is a Honda at a Honda price?, Without clarification it's the same as saying it's of cheap quality and of cheap price? and that couldn't be further from the truth., And as I said, othe carriers subsidize their phones too., A new modern Android 2.1 phone can't cost a mere $199, can it?, I've heard some good things about the iphone 4 myself, I noticed it's a little heavier and a little thinner too., But I also read an article on Bnet today discussing the 5 worst things about the iphone., Here's a link to the article: http://preview.tinyurl.com/theiphone4, Well in Canada, we have three carriers selling the iPhone., All are the same price, all for the same contract length., Apple?s commoditized the carrier, here at least., Curious circumstance of this is that it?s cheaper to pay early termination fees and sign a new contract on a new carrier than to buy the phone outright in the middle of your contract, especially if you factor in the $300-400 you get from selling your old phone., Admob has become one more cry baby like Google,  you are not Admob anymore you are Google now., Its stupidity if Apple allows you guys to take info of their iPhones., Does Google give its collected information to Microsoft or Yahoo if not then why should Apple give you the info., I need advice, real advice please!, the useless comments fanboys on both sides put up are such a waste of valuable space., m'kay, so I'm a 1st, 2nd, 3rd Gen iPhone user and I've had it with the horrible AT&T coverage and dropped calls., I was disappointed and shocked when WWDC10 didn't announce a verizon iPhone., Anyways, I made a few trips to the verizon store over the last few days to checkout the HTC Incredible., Here are some points that bother me very much and you'll notice its not just the phones?
- cut/copy/paste is a nightmare on the Incredible
- Android keyboard does not compare to the iPhone's in my mind., But voice input is a nice feature, it can be done on the iphone but you'll be switching apps (Dragon)
- light flash support on the droid is nice, but not worth switching for especially since you can't watch hulu and other sites like it
- turn-by-turn is nice, but the interface doesn't feel solid
- there are little UI and Phone built quality issues that I can't get over, like how cheap/inaccurate the Incredible screen and touch feel
- the battery warning on the Incredible came up after 10 minutes of just playing round!, I'm not sure if that's usual, but the iPhone 3GS battery isn't great either
- I'm too vested in the iPhone app store, great apps, but I never realized how vested I am in it now!, - all my podcasts and music on iTunes sync smoothly to my iPhone, I heard you'll need special setup and software to do this with the droid., I simply don't have time to invest in re-organizing my 30GB music library
- Apple continues to innovate with the iPhone hardware and Android is barely keeping up., - Google voice on android would be great, but google voice works fine on the iPhone through a web app 
I feel like I'm better off upgrading to iPhone 4 and waiting for a Verizon iPhone before switching., I just don't see any compelling handsets on Verizon today or in the near future to make me switch!!!!, Its possible that the next Android phone will beat the iPhone 4, but based on the quality of the Incredible I don't see how that can happen., advice please!, right, the sales figures prove this., you simply can't argue with that (try as they might), beyond impressed with the advanced android has made since the beginning., still not iphone-like yet though., android certainly has a leg up in some features (google voice, gmail integration, wifi hotspot), but overall the devices aren't there yet., yeah i love the people trying to say the EVO battery is fine., it's like stockholm syndrome., wow that sucks., heh not bad., I just can't see my grandparents walking into a store and saying, "I want the phone with HDMI out, an SDHC slot, and a replaceable battery." They did, however, walk into a store and say, "I want the iPhone.", well, you said yourself there is no 'Android' phone per se, so there really is no goal to have a uniform user experience for Android., instead, it's just apple vs non-apple., IMO, the real major difficulty android faces is converting iphone app developers to the android platform., all that tells me is that apple markets better., if they were more informed, they might actually decide based on features, versus just brand name., gunnar-tard, if you're going to be vulgar, as least use 'cum' so i don't have to sit there and try to interpret your stupid joke as poor grammar, which all you fucktards are guilty of., Actually what Apple do best is design and UI., Apple is more concentrated on how a user will feel when they press an on-screen button than the power of their developer APIs., Other companies have only begun to grasp that design and UI inspires gadget lust, not useful features., An iPhone user can talk about hardware spec, but in reality they know that wasn't the reason they bought the phone., The UI of Android is buggy, confusing and often rough around the edges, even with its powerful functions., The interface will determine Android's success., I don't dislike the iPhone or iPhone owners but I often hate the dogmatic arrogance of some that suggest the iPhone's flawlessness., Apple design is minimalistic., Too many companies make ugly Android phones., Only if Google concentrates on UI and if manufacturers concentrate on minimalistic design can Android secure a victory., It's not a dictatorship unless someone is forcing you to use an iPhone., I wish people would stop and think for a few seconds before throwing around these ridiculous metaphors., You act like you believe in choice, yet given the chance you'd take away my choice to have a Flash-free device, a curated platform, etc., Walled gardens can be quite beautiful, and some of us want them ? especially when, at one end of the garden, there's a big ole gate that opens onto the wilds of the internet., If you don't want one, don't get one, but don't act like you're some freedom fighter., Get a real cause., The point was that they don't have any idea what any of those things are., Most people don't know what they are (with the possible exception of HDMI)., Most people don't care., Even I don't care whether or not my phone has HDMI., They just want a phone that works., And you are right, Apple is marketing better., Android is going to take a little while to gain a foothold, but it may, and if they can polish their user interface, it might really take off., But it's crazy to say that a phone is inherently better just because it has some features that only tech-savvy people feel are important., Maybe those features will be mainstream one day, but that day is not today., I agree that it is great and better in many aspects, but to say that it is "worlds apart" I think is a little overstating., It depends on your likes and needs., For example:  if for me is "absolutely" necessary to have FM radio, iPhone won't be any better., "bring them all into one package" is true in many ways, like Starbucks that didn't invented coffee, but revolutionized the coffee shop (similar to Hershey, Ford, and others); 
? but,  I was enjoying my 5MP camera and video calls (over carrier) with my good old Nokia N95 one (or maybe two) years earlier!, My niece (8 yo)asked for my N95 instead of my wife's iPhone 3GS to play with the front facing camera and take group pictures with her friends., *** and it didn't had to be "all into one package" to enjoy it or to be useful., The same happened with turn by turn useful fully working (just works) experience of my N95 GPS system when iPhone didn't have a true GPS., I enjoyed the better sound of my N95 two speakers that sound clearly better and louder than any iPhone's and I don't know if the iPhone 4 has only one., ? 
Again, I don't argue if iPhone 4 is better (it is GREAT) but please don't say that iPhone 1, 2 and 3 didn't had ANYTHING below any competitor., I agree with you on many aspects ? but not on UI being buggy and Droid phones are ugly., That may be your perception rather than reality., I have both iPhone (since  Sep 2009) and Droid Incredible(since Apr 28, 2010)
Droid Incredible for the last 2 months use and never seen any issues with UI., Sense UI can be improved significantly and it is no where closer to iPhone., But iPhone cannot beat Droid on Openness it has and I know where to locate on SD card what files I have stored., Try that with iPhone and try to move them around without jailbreak and see what happens., UI makes the difference for many people., Mostly people who do not have Computer knowledge., But for people like me ? I figured out but it takes sometime to learn., Same goes without saying on iPhone UI as well., Since we get used to one interface than the other ? so it looks easy., Until we get there with other UIs, it is a long shot., Apple does it interestingly making the UI look like simplistic., But once you try to get around and try something which you cannot do ? then people get frustrated., This is not the case with Sense UI on Droid., I can almost do whatever I want to (ha ha not all but close to what I want to) on Droid., It takes time to learn the new UI which I was not familiar with., Yeah there are so many apps that are buggy which crash and that has nothing to do with the OS ? but rather the app., So you win some and lose some on any given phone for a techy person., So bottom line is it is individual preference that matters., There is no such thing as a complete gadget that can do everything and probably we will not see even in the next 5-10 years., That's the reality of all these gadgets., Hey!, it is like me saying "nicer screen, didn't Jobs said that the iPhone 3 screen was great" or "video editor?, I almost never edit video and when I do, I do it on a desktop", or "sapphire glass, do you know just how robust and resistant some other phones are" or "don't you think that an OS with just a large list of apps is now toooo simple and boring?" 
The fact that someone don't use or value some feature, it doesn't mean that it doesn't have some value., I use my N95 FM very much., When I jog, I like to simply select a station and hear music or news and don't "bother" with selecting playlists of _shuffle_ around new and old music in my collection (not that I hear MP3 more, but I like FM also)., If someone does not have data plan and no WiFi around, he can still use radio for news, weather and music ? even security warnings., By the same token, why people still watch TV it is a decades old invention., The same can be said of any feature that the other phone has better ?   it is a proof of concept., HTC and others will (as the have with other features) add a gyro, larger sensor, *even* better screens, ? 
Have any one used Nokia's N95 front camera?, It wasn't a proof of concept., I regularly made video phone calls with friends and family over the carrier (don't need WiFi)?, Some time even a friend helped me to fix a machine by the phone using the ability to show the image live., Why you have to prove anything if it was here years ago and working well (not talking like with Tablet PCs or Newton or ?)  it was and still is a *normal* unsurprising feature of many phones since a couple of years ago., The "relax" is a good idea, it just works both ways., Android will keep progressing also., You can't take down ANY phone in just to features., Is as if I said a year ago: "enough with the iPhone 3GS it is not a great device, it can't take 5MP pictures, it doesn't have front facing camera, it does not have iOS 4, [even not have FM radio], it can't do Google Voice, Google Turn by Turn, ? 
You could rightly say: "well, it does not do all that, but take a look at these features ?", Whenever Apple's products appeal to customers via attributes which can be easily quantified, people always chime in to say that anything that you cannot list down or quantify must be due to just image, branding and marketing., Sometimes a restaurant is better despite not having more or larger dishes or more extras or larger seats, but I guess if you cannot quantify it, it must be marketing., Perhaps, but for now, the iPhone still has the lead., Personally though I can't wait until Android gives the iPhone a better run for it's money., Competition is a great thing., [sarcasm!], Let me help you with your analogy, your saying Android is for nerds., Uh, have you tried comparing the prices of these handsets in countries where phones are actually sold unlocked for their real price rather than the US carrier shell game?, Here in Australia a base model 3GS goes for $799, whereas a Nexus One will set you back $839 and you still need to buy a Micro SD for storage., Hopefully one day you'll also see that the US network problem isn't AT&T, it's the fact that Verizon and Sprint are using their own US-specific CDMA instead of GSM which is used by AT&T and 5.8 billion of us foreigners., Apple clearly love the US market way above anywhere else, but it's still a lot to ask them to have two radically different versions of the hardware and baseband firmware for a device as precisely designed and engineered as the iPhone., "Android is just a different type of device, one that makes me feel like Im actually using a mobile pc and not a just a phone." 
This is when Yoda steps in to say "And that is where it fails."  ; ), "Every believed that iphone 4 would be revolutionary and now the Apple fanboys are claiming iphone 5 will be revolutionary [...]" 
Who are these fanboys saying this?, They don't happen to be fashioned from straw, do they?, Give him a bit., His battery is charging., I KID!, The five "worst" things, according to the article: 
1) The design sucks., 4) Video calling is a stupid idea., 5) The screen resolution is too high., Seriously, I had to double-check the address bar to make sure this article wasn't posted on The Onion., Why "still not iphone-like yet though"?, What can iPhone OS do that Android (or even Symbian) can't?, iPhone OS is application oriented, you HAVE to go to an specific app to Twitter, an other to see pictures of friends, ?   "even" Palm Pre can be PEOPLE oriented, ?  you simply tap on a picture (not a nice icon) of a friend or relative and you have mails, sms, twits, facebook, ? 
? 
Not related exactly with this comment but, they say "specs" don't sell ?  so, why the key note talked a LOT about screen resolution, camera resolution, gyro, front facing camera, quality of manufacturing, ?, even folders, and unified inbox can be (soft) specs., ? based on what?, it is true that it is a great phone, but ?
I have a great "experience" in my "magical" Nokia N95:  the "perfect combination of size and power"., What about all the things Android and even Symbians and WebOS phones do that iOS4 can't:
-  USB ports, dual speakers, FM radio, AMOLED, HDMI out, interchangeable battery, memory cards, 1.3 facing camera, free Navigation, ? 
Trying to be more less objective, I could say that the "race" is interesting, that it is difficult to spot a winner, ? 
with all my respect., That's right, but I again comes at what people says when confronted with some feature (yes a "spec") that an Android has and iPhone hasn't or has in a lower extent., Bigger screen, front facing camera (when iPhone 3GS, Apple fans use to say "yes, but why would I like a front facing camera?, I don't see myself using it;   or   with a 5MP camera ?>  "yes, but if I like to take great pictures, I would carry a Sony camera,   or with iPhone 1 compared with my N95 with GPS ?>  "yes, but my cellular tower *aproximation* is good enough" 
Can we say the same here, "yes, but 24 is standar and is good enough"?, I think this comment has common sense and well balanced., Speaking as an iPhone developer here, with a soon to be released game at http://www.frogatto.com , I can definitely say we're not targeting android in large part due to the fragmentation., We're having a hard enough time getting the iPhone controls right, and making sure every level is well-tuned, presentation-wise, for the iPhone's screen aspect., We've also optimized very particularly for the nuances of the iPhone's video board, and we find that although frogatto works great on every iPhone out there, no matter what we do, we're still getting back bizarre reports from linux users who get atrocious performance on some wacky hardware combo of theirs ? new hardware, too, not some celeron with a rage 128., It's like playing whack-a-mole., We're also targeting iPhone because we were a 'nix/OpenGL/SDL/C++ game, and we didn't want to rewrite the thing in the java/dalvik android requires., I could be wrong about this, but that's what I've heard is required ? it's the same reason we wouldn't write for XNA, or straight cocoa., Really ironic, too ? people keep talking about how locked-down the iPhone is, yet it's the single easiest platform to get the average linux game onto (besides maemo, but no one owns those)., Last but not least, the hackability of android makes piracy easy enough that it's probably going to become like piracy on a PC., Yes, a lot of pirates would never buy ? I've been one., However, it's also true that if piracy becomes insanely easy, most potential buyers end up pirating., Yes, piracy is possible on the iPhone (via jailbreaking), but it's hard., It's hard enough that normal people see "paying" as the only way to get a game., probably a vast legion of other indie developers, aren't even gonna touch android., We'll go for the platform on which our game is always guaranteed to work right, and on which we can actually get paid., Apparently, devs like squaresoft, EA, rockstar, and the rest, rather agree with out point of view., Wanking off to candids of Steve Jobs is making you lose you hair, MG., That was funny., MG has got to be the one person in the blog word if I met on the street I'd punch in the face and smash his iPhone just to watch him cry about it., No doubt extremely biased and annoying but passionate about his obession., I'll give him that., Android will win., The Evo's front facing camera and Apple's front facing camera are a perfect example of this., HTC released a front-facing camera, but there is software to use it., Apple released it on their phone later, but they went through a lot of development effort to make using it absolutely seamless, intuitive and easy., I promise you a lot more people will be using Video calling on iPhone 4s than all other mobile devices yet, put together., my MacBook Pro is running great after 3 years of intensive service (over 12 hours a day)., I tend to agree with Dror on one point., The sheer volume of Android devices is going to make the Android plaform a much more desirable development environment, and this will happen in the near future., Will this actually pull developers away from developing for iOS?, No, i don't think so., Developers are going to be much more likely to want their app on both platforms., It's a keynote for developers so it's VERY relevant, I am on the same boat as you though i have been an WM user for 4-5 years now and i havent tried Android devices or Iphone yet but i am definitely going for the next Iphone., The reason being the same as you i am tired of tweaking the phone every week trying new roms and the process is just too much hassle., I just want a device which works out of the box and gives me option of jailbreaking it., These are the top of the line phones we?re talking about here., If you don?t want to pay $200, there are hundreds of options to choose from., Conditioning my ass., (Actually, that?s not a bad idea.), I've played with both (I was at wwdc as Media)., iPhone 4 is richer, but colors pop noticeably more on N1's AMOLED display., I thought iPhone 4's screen was quite nice, but I think the whole Retinal thing will be lost on most consumers., The proof will lie in it's performance in sunlight., If it fails like AMOLED does, then Samsung wins out with the S-AMOLED tech on Wave and Galaxy S., MG, if you're going to keep insisting on reviewing phones on TC (and call a spade a spade, you've been REVIEWING as of late), you'd better learn your shit already., You have too much influence to keep writing from your "I'm not a reviewer" position of feigned ignorance., You're better than that., TC is a very 'specs oriented' community, so qualitative matters don't really win arguments., It's for that reason that the iPad got universally lambasted upon its reveal, yet was a hit with consumers., The same will scenario seems to be playing out with iPhone 4., I like the post, and I think that for a declared Apple fan; is more less neutral., But just, more less: 
I don't completely agree with "because he is able to *clearly illustrate* the differences in both iOS and Android", because he fails to see some arguably clear better features in some Android phones that iPhone 3GS is lacking:  front facing camera, FM radio, noise cancelling 2nd mic, screen resolution, better camera with dual flash, ? 
Sincerely, why can't he just wipe Android phones just like that?, Dude, it's just a forum., Go get a life., Apple has realised that the majority of people want things that 'just work'., You want to take apart your car, and I for one wouldn't let you near my Porsche., I doubt you could take apart and put back together a valve based radio., If you think that the iPhone is dumb, then you've missed the point of developing for real people, not techies., Smart people also use this thing called grammar and punctuation., You might like to try it., It makes your post a bit more readable, but wait, you're a droidboy, which means you think people should have to know language inside-out in order to understand you, and root their phone in order to make the battery last over 3 hours., The point: you missed it., Your analogy is wrong ? you CAN drive it into the red light district anytime (safari); Aston Martin simply chooses not to supply the car with the trunk full of porn mags., I dont think you should compare the speed of the iphone 4 to your 3gs, as you use your phone more it responds slower (a miniscule amount each time you barely notice it)  I bet if there was a side by side review of a fresh iphone 3GS and an iPhone 4 they will probably run the same., I hope the screen is durable it looks like its easy to break., Still 100% getting one though!, Point taken, The war is heating up and the who benefits from it is the consumer?err or that's what they want us to think., Apple likes to take things slowly and then claim "we made it better"., Google like to take the plunge and claim "we made it the best the very first time." In short, its the consumer who either ends up buying an expensive gadgets with much hype and no real value., Android is open source, i love it., Apple is beautiful, i love it too., So which of the two phones should i choose ?, Oh btw im sorry tech crunch for doing so but i just loved iphone 4 might be great article so i copied it on my blog with some pictures here http://www.sanjeevnanda.wordpress.com but don't worry i've mentioned the source in the excerpt., awesome analysis, thanks for the great advice, I really don't know what to say about this iPhone model., I'm just excited to have one like this., I suggest you look at the demo., Imo iMovie is better than WMM but that's just imo., Seriously look at the demo it's pretty sweet piece of software., Happened to Google at their conference a couple of weeks ago., I believe at the same place as well., Wifi isn't known for it's resistance to interference., Quit trolling., wow, exaggerate much?, IOs4 an aston and android a honda?, if anything, WebOs is a porsche, IOs4 is a non-M bmw, and android is an american muscle car?  apple has many, many improvements to make before they are an aston., Hiring palm's notifications guy was a good start, Know what?, I have an associate for whom I purchased an iPhone 3G., He lives and works in New Hampshire ? non-metropolitan New Hampshire (as if)., His previous phone ? a Sony Ericsson K790a never dropped a call as he drove through the hinterlands between Hanover and wherever., He was on AT&T then., I don't think that, in the last year, we haven't had one call that didn't get dropped at some point., Let me tell you, folks, it isn't the network, it's the damn phone., I wonder if JesusPhone IV is any better AS A PHONE?!, Easy there tiger, simply mistook wifi stations for wifi connections., android sucks, thats why you hate it, Here in the US, ALL phones are subsidized ? and when I go into cell phone stores, I have never seen the unsubsidized price or the size of the subsidy listed anywhere., And while people probably know that free phones don't actually cost $0 to make, I doubt many americans realize how big cell phone subsidies are, since we never see how much phones actually cost., (The exception is the relatively small number of people on pay-as-you-go plans., While you can use a smart phone with them, most opt for very simple, cheap phones., )  
So here in the US, with our subsidy-contract cell phone model, the only price that matters for 98% of people is the subsidized price., And how?d that one work out for you?Load up on the videoconferencing?, Or just spent hours trying to score your perfect avatar headshot?, So you essentially say that an iPhone costs the same as a Nexus One., Boy is that wrong., If you buy a 3GS at this time in Germany without a contract you would pay at least 600Eur (unlocked, black, 16GB)., A Nexus One costs less than 500Eur (unlocked)., Of course, they could of implanted these way back, but the great thing about Apple is they perfect it unlike HTC or any Android phones, they think of something and put it in a phone incomplete such as their multi-tasking which DRAINNS the battery, front facing camera which u have to go through a server to initiate and the 8mp camera on Evo is horrible etc?., even tho Apple is late on it they made it 10 times better., And thats what people fail to understand, Apple is not about competition but they are about quality., So ask your self what would u prefer "Quality or Quantity"?, and trust me i would wait not a year but 2 years for a new iPhone then get a phone thats incomplete., I think my issue with Android is I feel like a beta tester., My iphone is jailbroken, so I'm multi tasking today., I don't think MT is worth the unpolished feel that Android gives me., I have polish, performance, elegance and all the best apps to choose from., Android doesn't offer me that and the cheap app knock offs aren't a replacement for the quality apps I have., None of my core apps exist for Android., I use to own devices like these and I always suffered for it., I don't want to be the guy saying just 4 more months and I'll have that missing feature / app(s)., Once that changes for Android I'll give it another look., I think the frontier feeling is good and some people like it, but I've out grown it., Apple fanbois falling for false marketing?, Yeah and Droidboys falling for marketing stating that Sprints fake WiMax 4G is faster than ATT's or even T-Mobile's 3G by the end of the year., Last time I checked (4G)6Mbps<7.1Mbps(3G)., Last time I checked ATT has more markets in which this speed is attainable that Sprint's 4G., You're falling for the hype droidboy., Next time look for execution of features instead of a big spec sheet., Even if the iPhone is catching up on some aspects it implements those aspect to a greater degree than you shitty plastic device does., And those features that the iPhone has that the Android devices don't can I give you shit and say that Android sucks because it's just catching up?, Stfu troll., Hey droidboy you mind if I go roll you spec sheet in a blunt and smoke it?, Seriously though I don't do drugs., Stop falling for the marketing hype., Use an iPhone 4G before you start talking shit., Idk if you knew this but Aston Martins had GPS a couple of years after Honda implemented theirs., Does that change their build quality?, Lets go through your idiotic spec sheet., Sprint 4G is an inferior product that does not live up to it's name., Max theoretical 4G speeds are 6 mbps while 3G speeds are up to 21 mbps., Here in the US ATT is building up their network (testing in more markets as well than Sprints 4G) to 7.1 mbps so is T-Mobile., Wimax is not LTE., Keep your shitty outdated network., If you still support CDMA networks you're an idiot., There can and never will be a scientific analysis of browser speeds between Android and iOS., Don't believe what everyone tells you., I don't know if you realize that ANDROID uses APPLE's webkit in their browsers?, I don't know if you'll retract your statement but by your logic because Apple had it first it implements it better than Android?, One we'll never know and two your logic is stupid., If you have an iOS device you don't need flash., I have not found one Flash game that I can't play natively (try that with an Android device) and we all know that native is better than being played in two programs., There's an app for that., Youtube., Only thing iOS is missing is flash for porn., And even in that market Apple is revolutionizing and forcing them to use HTML5 standards., If you have a chance on Froyo look at your porn in Flash and then HTML5 and lets see which porn you'll wank to., Better screen?, Well Aston Martin can multitask much better than the Honda without using unnecessary power or tweaking the device., I'll be streaming Pandora while playing GTA., Can your droid do that?, A Honda can be customized?, Why would I want to customize a motor which is already superior to your Honda and has no need to be customized?, You're an idiot., Usb ports?, Apple has that., That's a spec to brag about in a phone?, Stereo sound only works when the speakers are at least a foot away., Stupid thing to say., There's an app for that., No seriously there is., That and most iOS devices have that built in just no drivers., I think the new screen of iPhone 4 trumps AMOLED., iPhone 4 will have that., Why would I want an interchangeable battery when I can buy a mophie, or when my phone can last more than 3 days without having to change the battery?, Seems to me that's a loss on the Android side for the Evo., Having to carry a battery just so your phone won't die is a loss., I'll somewhat give you that., Still I prefer integrated memory when it's put to such good use as iTunes., Look at the price of memory cards nowadays I'd prefer to buy two 16 gig memory cards than one 32 gig., If I have to carry extra cards for memory, well thats a loss., I like having something to backup and manage my music, apps, and video., When you have to drag and drop you lose., That and Doubletwist sucks., 1.3 front facing camera?, You're an idiot., You don't need a 1.3 front facing camera when it's going to be used for a phone call., VGA supports 480?640 resolution., More than enough for a phone call., Can you imagine how stuttery the call would be having to send 1.3 mp through a phone call?, I'd also imagine that the VGA camera in the iPhone is better than the Evo's 1.3., Megapixels aren't everything., iPhone has built in navigation what are you talking about?, Wait are you saying that Garmin and TomTom having enough interest to make navigation apps for iOS is bad?, Well I see that's something Android lacks., Spec sheets aren't everything execution is., what you been smoking
apple will take any chance to monopolize the market 
once they have that monopoly, they just impose instead of compete 
if android was not competing with them, the next iphone would not be version 4, but instead version "3gs-b" or something similar with much less features and nothing new or exciting 
a fair market is what we always need to aim for, android should not monopolize either (and is very hard thanks to being open), pure apple fanboy article., if you're a apple fanboy you shouldnt be reviewing other phones period., stick to   kissing Apples and Steve Jobs ass, I got myself a Samsung Google Moment, and it has worked wonders for me so far in my business transactions with great internet access., It?s important to find the companies with the best products when it comes to investing., Many stock investors could use some inspiration, and I have found that inspiration for myself, and hopefully for other traders at http://invetrics.com/ 
It is a great website with free stock trading signals updated daily and is up more than an incredible 80% for the year!, It has already earned me several thousands of dollars and more to come!, Make sure you check it out!, Mac had nothing to do with the mass adoption of USB., You can't drive the mass market when you have less than 5% marketshare., Apple had nothing to do with the development of USB., If anyone was driving adoption it was peripheral manufacturers., Just because you get rid of legacy ports all together doesn't mean you're driving adoption., Most other manufacturers had USB along-side legacy ports., Careful, the Crapple fanbois will always downgrade you with comments like that., You make a great point about pricing., Without Android, iphone buyers would still be paying $300+ on contract for these things., If you honestly belive that an iPhone 4g is better than the EVO.., having open source O/S is KEY to mutation!, In France you can buy iPhone from many carrier from 99eur to 349 eur depending on your plan !, Being a European iPhone 3G user (which I bought for 620 Eur, since subsidizing is considered to be illegal in my country), the main killer feature of the iPhone is still one thing Android cannot match at all, which is long-time software support., A friend of mine bought his HTC Hero a good while after I bought my 3G, but he's still running the ancient Android 1.6., That alone for me is enough to avoid Android., I have a 2 year old phone which will next month still get the latest software version available for it., Now imho, after 2 years ? supporting a phone wouldn't be necessary anymore ? but they still do., If Google only forced phone manufacturers to support the latest Android version on their phones for at least 2 years, almost all of my gripes with Android would be solved., For now however, I'll stick with the iPhone, and I'll upgrade my aging 3G to the iPhone 4 asap., he can upgrade to the latest version., Android is open source and can be installed quite easy (even if your carrier doesnt do it for you), many guides on the internet for that., tell him to update to froyo, he should get a nice increase in speed., I dunno?how about shooting HD video AND being able to edit it on the freaking phone?, How about running any app that requires a gyroscope?, How about providing a platform that actually gets developers paid?, How about an advertising system that is unintrusive and doesn't pull you from your apps?, How about a multitasking system that doesn't drain the battery at a breathtaking pace?, How about a non-fragmenting OS that only drops support for phones once they truly become legacy (three years out instead of 3 months)?, Android CAN'T approach iPhone because of the lack of verticality., It can only mimic the iOS insofar as it doesn't differ completely from it., That is, in what it tries to do that is iPhone-like, it will fail to meet the mark., It can only really differentiate itself in what it does that is DIFFERENT than the iPhone., Google GPS is pretty slick., So is 4G tethering?but the problem is, the sales numbers show that what people WANT is the iPhone., What they may not want is AT&T ? so they pitch in for Android., "there is a big dog in Town and it is called ANDROID., you will have to live with that from now on., " 
"SHAKE AND BAKE!, THAT?..JUST HAPPENED!!" 
Who TALKS like this?, Nice comment and an interesting different angle one., But, with all respect, don't you think that is a mater of taste an priority?, I think (IMHO) that it could be like a "weighted" matrix., If, for example, I use my FM radio very much while jogging and I don't do ANY video editing nor production (not even in a desktop); two phones, one with FM radio but without video editing capability and the other with that capability, but no radio would be of VERY different VALUE to two different people?, If, in an other example, I am a serious video person, so involved that I take my videos with an almost pro video camera and do my editing production with a desktop (maybe a Mac Pro); maybe I would like/appreciate iPhone 4's video capability, but also maybe I wouldn't use them at all, because they are less than my special camera and desktop software., And, yes off course, I could be in the middle and totally ENJOY the iPhone 4's proposal., I don't think it is an ABSOLUTE measuring without weighted ponderage., ??
The same happened when someone answered (before iPhone 4) to a "look, my Nokia N95 can do video calls, or have a 5MP and Video (vs thats time 2M and no video original iPhone)";  Apple enthusiasts (the correct respectful word, I think) could have said "yes, but I don't need SO MUCH camera resolution and who wants FM radio or make a video call., If I would like to take a nice picture, I would get it with my Sony dedicated camera"  or so., The same I could say about "so much" video resolution; or the games I don't play, or the video editing I don't use or EVERY app that I need and actually find for Symbian., BUT, that is not the issue; it is that we have to prioritize or weight the features vs our likes or needs., It is not a nice debate when each "side" just "trashes" everybody's comment, because it does not *fit* his or hers likes or needs., "Sense UI can be improved significantly and it is no where closer to iPhone."
I don't understand how a simple (maybe boring) list of liveless (aside from red circles notifications) can with to a live screen with live background, with widgets, with all the social, weather, time, ? info and "personality" that you can add., Also, it seems that Apple got a hint (off course not copied) the "square factor" that some phones (like some HTC ones) have before it., In fact, it is a great think., But to be a fan or an enthusiast is as good with a great product like an iPhone than an other great one like a Nokia or an EVO., The only problem could be (for any fan, Apple, Android, ?) that s/he was so closed that he can't see the other phone's advantages or its phone limitations., If I, for example, can't see that my Nokia N95 has low battery life or fail to recognize that iPhone 4's great screen;  but the same happens all the way around, failing to recognize nice features of Android and HTC EVO, for example., Speaking of Apple's App Store, will the new Iphone have an app to support making voice calls?, One more thing? the new Iphone is ugly for those that need to have it explained to them., Sterile designs are not art., That shiny slab, devoid of design features, so inexplicably attractive at first, becomes intensely annoying to gaze upon after about thirty days., It's exciting at first, like moving into a brand new house with brilliant white walls., And then? 
Anyway, thank you Android, Google, HTC, and Sprint for making an enjoyable smartphone., You are ABSOLUTELY right!, I'm seeing more and more reports of the same type of thing around the net., It IS the damn Iphone dropping the calls and NOT  always AT&T., What if the gyroscope makes the iPhone and next generation iPod touch a gamepad for a new cheap Apple TV that can play console quality games?, Not saying it's definitely going to happen ? but Apple is thinking two or three steps ahead of everyone else and I bet the gyroscope is part of their future plans., So why not get the developers understanding how to use the CoreMotion APIs in preparation for when the next shoe drops., you are a material girl living in a material world., I like when any of us recognizes the virtues of the "other" phone or OS., Even that I like an EVO more than an iPhone, I don't think that iPhone sucks; I think it is great., But also, I don't think that Apple is the only innovative company., Apple has many of its own ideas inspired in other ones ideas [the phone and cellphones themselves were invented by others  ;) ]; as well as many, many original ones; and some other's ideas better implemented., But, that is not to say that other phone companies aren't also very innovative., Try to transcend beyond worshipping old workarounds as ideals, for example, electric cars don't need a transmission so it doesn't matter you can't get "manual"., Also, gasoline-combustion automobiles require you to make detours from your route to stop at gas stations (euphemistically referred to as "convenience" stores), while electric cars have the additional benefit of recharging at your destinations., New paradigms allow us to let go of old klutzy workarounds like manual transmissions., People don't need to know how to program in 0's and 1's in order to develop GUI applications, but instead can stand on the shoulders of those who already have., No need to be a mechanic if the device is designed well enough to take care of itself and allows the user to excel beyond the device, so the device will essentially seem invisible when in use., Having to reach for a stick-shift (or a task manager) is having to start juggling and take up a distraction from the user's interests., Gawd, I've been waiting to upgrade my 3G., A long, long wait., I love my iPhone., I ordered my update this afternoon., Its a back ordered Evo 4G., If Apple thinks they can keep market share in 2010 with a 3.5 inch display running on a substandard network, they might be mistaken., I really wanted to stay with Apple, but, um?., Practice your reading?..^^!!, It?s subtle things like this ? things that most people will never even realize they?re noticing (but they are) ? that make Apple, Apple., is that your vag i smell stinkin??, shut it, LOL ur comments get funnier and dumber each time i read them?way to go spencer, ur really well liked around here!, great i hope!, hahaha so are you trying to say Apple is not quality??, would everyone shut the hell up about asto martins and hondas?.shit is stupid!, Hi Mu?oz, 
Don't you get it?, The radio is just an example, just substitute it for other feature that iPhone 3GS (or 3, 2 or 1) didn't had that other phones did., Some people when not getting something they say "I don't want it anyway"., Ok iPhone 4 has a very nice screen, maybe it is more than I need, maybe a screen with less resolution would be fine; but still it is better than most., I would like my phone to have one like that, but I don't say "I don't like that", I *recognize* that it is a better screen even though I still prefer other phone., Then again, there are features that I (or somebody) don't use, but still doesn't hurt to have them:  standard USB, yes the radio, Google Voice, Flash, real multitask, ? 
Again, I don't say that some phone is better than other, just that there is no *absolute* winner in *all* features., Thanks, Mu?oz, 
I can gladly explain any misunderstood comment., Just, that I feel that it is too easy to knock down any argument or device or phone just stating a couple of cons it has., If I don't like a couple of things of iPhone, say its power button fails or it didn't had real GPS (the original one); I couldn't say "hey, the iPhone is not a great device, it still doesn't have this and this feature"., I could *recognize* that it has many great features; but also _critique_ some lack of others so it can be improved., See how iPhone 4 is better than previous ones?, It now has some features *it missed* like (again):  better camera, (a version of) multitasking, front facing camera, not recessed earphone jack, ?  
Sincerely, 
Sp, When are you people gonna stop this fucking praising apple? It?s not that I don?t like apple? But iam fed up listening about iphone, ipod, ipad? There are many things going around the world?, I'm still going to get the iPhone, never had a dropped cal in my life., That aside, there is tethering, and there has been for a while., Officially enabled by AT&T May-June., Apple has had it since 3.0., Video calling for FaceTime is an open protocol and could be used by many other things such as iChat., If you watched the demo for video editing you would see that it is very easy and functional., Albeit, not a full-fledged editor but the best on a phone to date and more than enough for a phone as it is., I also believe I read somewhere that removable batteries have a slightly worse life than built in ones, I may be wrong., I know that I wouldn't want to carry around spare batteries with my phone., What Apple worshippers such as the writer have to ask themselves is: If the Iphone is so affordable and such a magical thing, how come the rest of the world is so blind as not to see it and buy it?, The answer lies in that most people like to have what is called a mobile phone., That is a phone that works and produces clear, useable communication., The author might be satisfied and impressed by the pseudo-deco aesthetics of Apple products, but there are more people that prefer that their communication device produce clear communication., Apple worshippers love to make fun of these people, but they are really laughing at themselves., The Iphone is beautiful but does not provide all the advances that have been made in mobile phone technology., Excuses will be put foward as to why that is the case, but it is not the most advanced device out there., It is a media player with a so-so phone attached to it., It is a device with very few features that are made to work well and for that Apple deserves credit., If it start to smell like their is not much choice in that, you are getting the point., You also don't own this device, you are renting it and you must stay connected to the Cupertino mothership in order to use it., Try to cut the ladder to the mothership (Itune) and you will see that what is left in your hand is no different than a beautiful flower pot., Like all Apple's products, it is a media consumption device with little concern for the need of the user., So, OK you are told that you are an elite user and that you are part of a life style.But, stop fooling people into thinking that the aesthetics of the device is what is important., Again, communication should be the selling point of the device., 'Familiarity breeds contempt,' but with Apple/Steve Jobs worshipers unfamiliarity with other products breeds contempt., In the Iphone vs Android phones debate, the only thing to remember is that Android phones are not supposed to be just like the Iphone, but a different and better communication device., It is clear that the Iphone will continue to ride and win the cool/beautiful wave for a long time., It is clear that tech writers will continue to be impressed by its pseudo-deco aesthetics.One day, they will have to recognize that there are different ways of implementing this technology., So, when an Iphone devotee is rejecting how communication technology is being implemented today he is only expressing his familiarity with the limits of his Iphone., Online, reviewing Android phones as if they were Iphone tend to get laughable., how much do u get paid to blow steve jobs ??, What's Hot:, Check out our 2010 Holiday Gift Guide - new stuff is being added all the time., ?An iPhone Lover?s (Initial) Thoughts On iPhone?4, Got a tip?, How To Recreate That Facebook Profile Picture Hack

Retina display is razor sharp ? One of the fastest cameras we've seen in a phone, Bad: The much-discussed antenna issue ? Design lacks the ergonomics of previous models ? Not a substantial performance bump from 3GS, Available plans: 47 plans available starting from $50 to $398, Embed on your site, Reviewing the iPhone 4 a month after its US release seems like the work of a cartographer re-mapping New York city; there isn't an opinion to form that hasn't been blogged, tweeted or screamed out about since the phone hit the streets five weeks ago., But of those million little voices praising or cursing the latest Apple smartphone, which ones are correct and which are coloured in bias?, Designer woes

Physically speaking, the iPhone 4 represents the most significant shift in aesthetic for the iPhone to date., Gone is the curved plastic finish and in its stead you find cold, reflective glass., Around the edges are stainless bands, most notable for being the phone's antenna ? the cause of the entire antennagate issue, but more on this later., Up front is the iPhone's 3.5-inch, 640x960-pixel resolution display, codenamed Retina by Apple which professes that the screen is so sharp that the human eye cannot differentiate individual pixels from one another., While this may be true, the human eye would also be hard-pressed to differentiate the clarity of the iPhone's screen from any on its competitors using a 480x800-pixel resolution display ? these extra pixels are wasted on a screen this size., Though the new design looks fantastic in renders on the Apple website, in the hand it feels cold and industrial., It lacks the subtle ergonomics of previous iPhone models and the brushed steel trim feels sharp against our much softer fingers., Speaking of fingers, be prepared to wipe maniacally at the fingerprints that accumulate not only on the touchscreen, but also across the glass backside of the new phone., People often buy thin plastic screen protectors for touchscreen phones, but we wouldn't be surprised to see thin plastic handset covers hit the market for the iPhone 4 before long., The new iPhone 4 beside the iPhone 3G.(Credit: CNET.com)

Current iPhone users will find little else to coo over once they power up their latest gadget., As with the experience of buying a new Mac or PC, once you boot it up there is an inevitable disappointment to be greeted by the same old operating system as before., If you've downloaded the iOS 4 firmware for your 3G or 3GS then you'll find there are no surprises short of the new phone processing slightly faster., The continental grip

In tennis, the continental grip is a standard racquet grip, which is excellent for return of serve, or so we've been told., If you hold the iPhone like this, however, you can expect a nasty shock., Yes, we're talking about the iPhone "death grip", and if you thought Apple would solve this issue before daring to release this phone in Australia then you'd be wrong ? dead wrong., The first thing we did with the iPhone 4 when we ripped the plastic off the milky white box was grab it in the death grip and watch for the signal bars to disappear., It takes about 30 seconds before the first bar drops, then the fall off is steady after that., But what does this all mean in real-world situations?, It's one thing to watch signal bars come and go, but does this issue affect the way the phone operates?, This depends on where you use the phone., When we tested the phone in the city with strong network coverage, phone functionality remained fine even when the iPhone reported only one bar signal., We ran online speed tests to trial the death grip data throughput and we couldn't find any noticeable loss of speed., Though we did see wild fluctuations in results, we couldn't isolate this issue as being related to the design flaw., However, when we tested in an area of low network coverage, we saw a much more serious issue., Starting with two or three bars of signal the so-called death grip killed the phone's reception entirely and the iPhone continued to report "No Service" until we moved our hand., If you are someone who struggles for reception anyway we suggest you choose a different phone., Quick draw

Though much of the iPhone 4's hardware remains the same as the previous model, the 5-megapixel camera module has seen a vast improvement., Apple is using a new backside-illuminated image sensor in this camera, which is technology only just adopted by manufacturers of compact point-and-shoot digital cameras, and by no other mobile phone manufacturer., This sensor is designed to deliver better low-light photography, which is a plus for a camera you'll probably take with you everywhere you go., A shot in our studio with a 100 per cent crop inset.(Credit: CBSi)

Photos we've taken in dark rooms under dull incandescent lighting have turned out extremely noisy, as you might expect., But while the image becomes grainy, the iPhone camera still manages to keep the light levels quite high., Under better, some might say more normal lighting conditions, the iPhone camera is among the best camera phones we've tested, and almost certainly the fastest., From the moment you hit the shutter button on-screen it takes less than 300-hundredths of a second to capture., This speed means you can capture those magic moments, and your photos won't suffer so greatly from blurry pics due to handshake., The iPhone 4 also records HD video, but we're not as impressed with this feature., You could argue that the video capture is better than on other phones (a statement we will test in an upcoming feature) and there will always be someone to shoot a short film using the iPhone as a gimmick., But we can't get past the fact that the resulting video you will most likely shoot with the iPhone will be shaky, often out of focus and accompanied by a tinny, wind-blown audio track., Performance

Would you expect anything less than first-class performance from an iPhone?, We wouldn't either., Apple has set its benchmark high with the previous models, but still manages to squeeze out noticeably, if slightly, better processing performance, with thanks to its new A4 1GHz processor., Side by side with an iPhone 3GS you can see web pages load faster and apps launch quicker, but only by a matter of moments., The new multitasking feature baked into iOS 4 works well on the new hardware and is a major improvement that affects iPhone usage across the board., As we've discussed previously, the multitasking is a saved state implementation, and while this is limited in its functionality, it does help to speed up workflow across multiple apps., If we have one complaint about the iPhone 4's performance it's that it doesn't differ greatly from the performance of last year's iPhone 3GS., With the iPhone 3GS still for sale this year, customers could pick up last year's model for less but enjoy the excellent user experience., Overall

Apple tried every shady trick in the book to cover up "antennagate", from blaming its customers for holding it wrong, to blaming it on its network signal attenuation algorithm, to playing down the severity by dragging other mobile vendors into the debate., When it's all said and done, you simply can't deny there is a flaw in the phone's design and an easily replicable network reception problem., Slipping a band-aid on the antenna will fix this issue, but it doesn't mask the fact that Apple has designed a phone with a flaw that you won't see on any other smartphone, and for this reason the iPhone does not get our Editors' Choice award., That said, those who don't mind covering the antenna with a rubber bumper or case will buy a very capable smartphone., It doesn't multitask like a BlackBerry and it isn't customisable like an Android, but the iPhone is slick, fast and supported by the largest of the applications stores., Just remember to take a look at last year's iPhone 3GS before you commit to the new iPhone 4; it may not be the latest gadget on the shelves, but it very nearly matches the newer model's performance and you'll pick it up on a cheaper plan., Find the best Apple iPhone 4 plans available., Apple iPhone 3GS, Apple releases iOS 4.0.1 update to fix signal bar issues, Apple iPhone 3GS, Next ?, Next ?, Available from 15th Nov to 31st Dec 2010, HP's MediaSmart Server Sale is on NOW, - From just $499, Click here for Dells Special Deals of the Day, Click Here!, What products made it to the top of the testing heap last month?, Cut to..., Best Android smartphones, Around 18 months ago Google's Android operating system was more a promise..., We looked long and hard for flaws in the Desire HD but failed to find..., In celebrating the 12 days of Christmas competitions, we asked our readers..., Sure it looks like an iPhone, but on the inside the Galaxy S is a..., Check out the latest LG 3D products, See how good life can be with the latest 3D TV?s and recorders from LG., Its 3D You Can Feel., Believe that anything you can imagine, you can make real., Now on Vodafone Infinite

I don't have the new I-phone4 yet, but I plan on getting one, soon., One thing that I've noticed about human beings is that, New items that we don't like mean nothing to us, hence, we complain and bad-mouth and destroy other peoples' hand work and a commitment to product improvement., The fact is that no matter the products, not everyone will like them., It could be a new house, a new vehicle, new clothing style, new rules, new websites, new company..whatever these new things are, there will always be pros and cons, supports and critics, lovers and haters., That's just the way life is., For those who don't like the new I-Phone, return it, sell it, exchange it or give it away., There are also those who don't like other phone brands, that is their problem., I've never liked Apple products (Computers, actually), but I love the I-phones., My problems, yeah I know :), same goes for those who don't like the I-phones., ??
For those who are reading this or other reviews, don't let the reviews, good or bad, influence your decisions, because we all have different tastes, but try the phone or any phone, yourself, then draw your conclusions., We all do different things and applications with our phone., Whatever phone you purchase should be able to handle your projects and tasks., If not, look for another phone that can fulfill your needs., As for me, right now, it's Apple phone., Thank you, MaximumPC, for your unbiased review, as it is open-minded.?

I was disappointed in the review, because I think it made excuses that wouldn't have been made with other products from other companies., ?In particular -
?1) iPhone 4's new features aren't as robust as the similar features on other phones:
?? ? a) Video calling - Fring+Skype on an EVO means video calling to Mac's, PC's, and other phones, over 3G, 4G, or WiFi and was available before the iPhone., The iPhone 4 can only call...the iPhone 4, and that only over WiFi.?
?? ? b) Multitasking - Um, still not caught up?, ?? ? c) Fine screen - Yes, it's very sharp, looks great held close to your face., Big EVO screen - Works great as a GPS, readable from a?convenient?viewing distance, etc.., A matter of?preference, ?
?? ? ?d) What other new feature did it have again?, ?
2) When you buy a cellphone in the United States, it is tied to the carrier., Pretending the problems with AT&T don't exist would be like not rating a PC poorly because it shipped with Vista almost a year after Windows 7 was out., Except that you can at least upgrade vista, you are stuck with AT&T., The problems with AT&T, by themselves, should bump the phone down to a 6., The antenna problems reinforce that., ?Further, AT&T's new data plans really affect whether or not you even use the phone., AT&T (and eventually Verizon) should?definitely?be part of the review., 3) Fundamental design flaws - if the "bumper" case is more or less required, and the battery isn't removeable, and it requires a special charger cable rather than cheap generic USB..., those are all serious negatives that wouldn't have been passed over with other products., ?
I'm going to guess that the EVO would have rated an 8, because while it does have some real issues (4G killing the battery) but also some major pluses and it did break new ground (4G, video calling, and hot spot ability.) I love my EVO, but I can be honest that it's got flaws., I didn't like your review, because it dismissed the iPhones flaws, and failed to put its strengths into proper perspective., ?

The fascinating thing about OS X is it has very little appeal to the intermediate user market, while being very appealing to both novice (or deliberate know-nothing) users and uber-geek power users., Trust me, if you have to spend a lot of time in the UNIX/Linux world, OS X is great., Having a laptop OS that is stable, offers modern features, integrates well with its hardware, and is essentially just a nice GUI running on top of fully POSIX-compliant *ix is piceless., Of course, this thread is about the iPhone and iOS4., Neither of which I have any interest in paying for., Apple's restrictive policies have guaranteed I'll never own an iPad or iPhone., The high PPI screen is the one thing I really find interesting...and I'm sure HTC will release an Android phone featuring a screen of the same quality within a couple of months., Login or register to post commentsMore like the iOpps 4

Ill get it out there right now., I hate Mac and everything that has to have a lower case i for the first letter of its name and when I heard about the iPhone 4 I could care less until I heard about the issues the phone has., I honestly can not believe that a company that supposively prides itself on quality would let a phone get past the prototype and testing phases with such a glaring issue such as how you hold the phone itself will degrade the signal strength and then say to solve the problem is to go and BUY a case for the phone., To me, this plainly sounds like the company is trying to squeeze an additional $30 or so dollars from people who have to have the latest thing., Surely someone at some point (ie a left handed employee) took hold of the phone and noticed the bars dropping off one by one like land in an hour glass, right?, I suppose in the end its another thing to add to my list of things to throw into a mac fanatics face when they start bashing PC style electronics., Login or register to post commentsBSOD on Iphone?!, Submitted by cashboxxer on Tue, 06/29/2010 - 4:23am

Any true gadget enthusiast will agree that a company that releases a device that has major issues like this, which directly prevent the device from doing what it's supposed to do, should officially be called a piece of shit.? 
?I was about to buy a Buell motorcycle and i could not stand the controls on the handle bars, so i told my friend, if i got it, i'd change them..., he said, do you really want to buy something you aren't happy with in the first place.? i think the same idea applies here, you're looking to buy a complete product, not something the creator scoffs at and gives you a seriously asshole comment in return.? 
I'm the kind of guy that uses what works, i own a Mac Mini to do senseless things because it's quiet and small, even though i got ripped on the price and the sales people suck hairy nuts, also i needed to learn the the ins and outs about them to help out clients of mine, but the OS is just horrible.? I own a Palm Pre because the multitasking just kicks ass, even though i get very jealous of the speed of the iphone and the screen of the evo, but i need physical buttons and the ability to do multiple things..., not play games
how people can invest in a product they know will be a replaced in a year, is beyond me.? I rebuild my computer every 2-3 years, just throwing small parts in every now and then if i see a good deal, and that's still too quick of a turn time for me.? i can really get the most out of my hardware for another 3 years..., apple treats there customers exactly how they are, like morons..., you spend too much on hardware, and you buy a new one every year with minimal upgrades, some which hurt the performance of the product..., stupid mac fanboys, that's just nonsense

I personally?don't mind the iPhone., Yes there are things that other smart phones do better than the iPhone., But at the same time there are things the the iPhone does better than other smart phones., I do?personally believe that the limitation to AT&T is crippling how well the phone could be doing, and?Apples business strategy of "Can we control it?" Third Party Vendor:?"Well, no it's open-" APPLE: "LALALALALALALALALALA We don't?like you!, LALALALA!" is not conducive to popularity in any way., ? As of right now, I have an iPhone 3G that is surviving through a deployment in Afghanistan.?I don't use it as a phone?right now, but other than that i've had no issues with it at all., This is not my first iPhone either., My first one had an odd software/hardware issue that even the Apple Store people shrugged helplessly at., I was promptly given a free replacement on the spot (the current?iPhone?I have now)., I had bought the phone used?and didn't have the choice of having product insurance., So I have to give a bit of a kudos to Apple on that.?
? Any other gripes that I have comes down to formatting issues of Apple themselves, the fact that they doomed themselves to AT&T for 5 years, and that they don't like to admit that they f***ed up on anything., the antenna issue that Steve Jobs told people to just hold the phone a different way and other issues that are?non-iPhone related) It's all just general Apple-ness and the network., ___________<("<)? <(" )^? ^( ")>?

The antenna problem alone should make the max score no higher than a 7 and possibly a 6.? Having to purchase a case separately from the phone to eliminate the problem (other than holding the phone as Apple recommends) is enough to make me not want to upgrade my 3GS when I am eligible next year.?

Just to put my comment in perspective., I use whatever technology is best., I had a Macbook only because I got it for $300 bucks when it was worth $800., When the Alienware m11x came out, I went there and sold my Macbook., I like the Macbook, but the operating system sucked., I would consider myself a fan of Android and will hopefully be picking up one of the new Droids for Verizon soon.?
?That being said, I think that Alex's review is accurate., Sure, there is the problem with the antennae, but you have to be left handed and it is easily fixed by a case., I saw reviews for the Evo 4G which gave it an 8 out of 10 and they had to charge that thing three times in a day., You can't fix that with a case., The new iPhone is a great product., I wouldn't want it, but come on., It's screen resolution beats that of electronics twice it's size (think Droid X)., It's got 10 million apps and more coming down the pipes., Personally, I think it's web browser trashes Androids, but that is my own opinion., Great review MPC!?

Really?, I don't care how amazing a phone is and how many amazing features it has, if I'm not allowed to hold it in any way I see fit that is an automatic fail in my book., I don't care if its Apple, Microsoft, Motorola whatever!, That is complete and utter bullshit and you all know it., And don't give me this, "well all you need is to buy a case for it to work properly"..., what!!??, I mean really!!??, I've never been a fan of cases for any of my phones and I should NOT be required to use one in order for it to work properly!, ?
How can you guys write this: 
"Every time we held the case with a finger touching the lower left-hand
part of the band, the signal strength would drop by up to four bars., Simply holding the phone in a common,
natural way is enough to cause slower browsing and dropped calls."
And then go ahead and give that product an 8!!!???, MPC isn't the first to do it, but certainly was the last ones I would expect to swallow this horse shit.?

The new Apple iPhone4 is the most perfect product we've tested in years.? It exceeds our expectation in every way.? It truly deserves a "10" with a "Kick Ass".? However, the antenna issue is quite serious and as a result it loses 2 whole points to receive a score of "8"., ?

Submitted by MaximumMike on Fri, 06/25/2010 - 10:10pm
Ok, Maximum PC I am very disappointed with this article, but not because you chose to write about an Apple product., I'm disappointed because this seems to be the same mindless drivel I read on pro-Apple sites all over the internet., I am disappointed because of the justifications you give for the article and the seemingly biased conclusions you come to., You say of iMacs and Macbooks that "these machines are, for all intents and purposes, personal computers." 
Thank you!, Seriously, thank you., The Mac versus PC debate is like the car versus automobile debate, or the woman versus human being debate, or the rotweiler versus dog debate, or the letter versus document debate..., Thank you for getting it., Macs are PC's and I am sick of listening to Apple and just about everyone else in the PC community say other wise., This is a magazine that writes on news in the PC community, and I want to hear news on all the players, including Apple., However, you have a sister magazine that writes exclusively on Mac's implementation of the PC platform, so I do prefer to see MAC articles kept at a minimum., But that's not the point because mobile devices are by no means pc's, and that goes doubly for mobile devices that run Apple software., So, your statement seems a little disengenuous., Nonetheless, wireless routers aren't PC's either, but they have a significant impact on PC's and I want to know about them., I feel the same way about mobile phones, so I'll give you that one., I know it seems that I am getting knit picking here, but the overall article sat completely wrong with me, and I'm just getting started., You said, "We try to keep our Apple coverage to a minimum..." 
?Seriously, three articles in a row on the iPhone?, When have you ever posted three articles in a row on any other smart phone?, And the article on Facetime..., That's exactly the kind of stuff you should leave up to MacLife., Am I to next get an article when Apple changes the font set in Safari?, But I do I get it., When the Apple product has a significant impact on the market, I want to know too., But you guys don't think this is over kill?, This is exactly why I felt you were so disengenuous on my previous point., You posited the following ridiculous statement., "It?s simply impossible to cover smartphones in any authoritative way
while ignoring the biggest single player in the field..., Here?s everything you need to know about the
device, and how it?s going to change the mobile landscape."
Really?, Ok, in numbers of raw sales of a single model handset, the iPhone is the number one seller, but Android is the largest and most influential platform., Both selling more handsets and existing on every major carrier, easly making it the biggest player., That's not to say that I don't still want some rudimentary understanding of the impact that the iPhone is having, because I do., However, how is it that you think the iPhone 4 is changing the mobile landscape?, For the most part it is last year's news., A 5 megapixel camera is paltry on a flagship device., And so are many of the other specs, like the lack of a memory card slot and the gimped multitasking., And you say all this in light of the HTC EVO which runs on the only 4G network in the country and dwarfs the iPhone in almost every category except for screen resolution and the gyroscope., Yet, the EVO has a noticably larger screen and still very high quality resolution., So, that's a toss up for many people., So is the ability to have six axis of rotation the BIG acheivement you think is going to transform the way the world looks at smartphones?, Watch out Nintendo you've got some serious competition., Seriously though, the iPhone wasn't even in the market place first and so they can't even try to boast about that., In all fairness to your stance on authoritatively reporting on smartphones, why didn't you stand in line for an EVO?, Where were all the articles that reported on every trivial facet of Sprint's release of this truly ground breaking phone that is in a class all of its own?, Don't you realize the impact this device is having right now; that it has a built in wifi access point; that it offers HD streaming to the internet; that (atleast to my knowledge) video calling works over the wireless network and does not require a wifi connection; that Sprint completely restructured its pricing plan and annihilates the competition with its data packages and content; that this device is delivering wireless services that you can't get anywhere else and at a cheaper price than the competition?? This is the device that is "going to change the mobile landscape." Why only two paragraphs on the specs of this phone?? 
?4., This statement is probably the most absurd and dishonest statement in the entire article and made me want to puke: "With the iPhone 4, Apple has done what was necessary to retain its
title as manufacturer of the most polished, most full-featured
smartphone on the planet."
How can you possibly come to that conclusion in light of your own words?, In every single section of your article you point out a gaping flaw in the phone: not as scratch resistant as it is purported to be, the antenna issue (a serious design flaw with one of the worst hacks and most expensive workarounds I have ever heard of), only a 5 megapixel camera on a flagship phone with video calling that only works over a wifi network, and gimped multitasking., Even in the two places where the phone is said to really shine, resolution and gyroscope, there are issues which although they are not really Apple's fault and will be resolved over time were still present on launch day., The overwhelming majority of apps have not updated to take advantage of the resolution, so much of the graphical experience can still be poor.There are very few applications available that take advantage of the gyroscope, making it a non event for the time being., And you call this a well polished phone?, That was practically the only phone you dared to compare it to., ?And then Verizon just announced the Droid X which is almost identical to the EVO with the exception of the front facing camera., Neither Verizon or Motorola have announced whether this phone will be compatible with Verizon's 4G LTE network which it will roll out later this year., But if this phone is not, you can bet there will be a flagship phone with even better specs to go along with the launch of that network., Although their markets have very little to do with ours, it bears mentioning that Korean and Japanese devices are far more advanced than any in the US.? And we are not likely to see another iPhone offering for atleast another year., The iPhone 4 is most certainly not the "most full-featured
smartphone on the planet." Furthermore, it is not even likely to continue to be very high end for much longer., T-Mobile has been upgrading its 3G network and purportedly is getting speeds comparable to and sometimes better than Sprint's, although T-Mobile's network is not officially 4G., We are yet to see their high end offerings which will undoubtedly come., Lest AT&T fall behind, I imagine they will have some better offerings whenever they roll out their 4G network as well., In know that this last bit is highly speculative, but not without good reasoning., And besides, the presence of but one phone that is demonstrably better than the iPhone proves my point, and I already have 2 examples., There are only two reasons I can think of for this article and neither is pretty, either blatant bias or blind ignorance and lack of research., Both are evidence of poor journalism., I really do love this magazine, but wake up guys., You have been writing lots of articles here lately trying to convince your readers that you don't have a secret bias for Macs., Why do you think that is?, I doubt it., I hate Macs, but not because of blind hatred for Apple., I hate Apple products because they are notorious for producing sub par products and selling them at a premium price and then having disengenuous aritcles like this one over hype them., I hate Macs for the same reasons I hated Microsoft and Intel throughout the 90's., Microsoft has since produced Windows XP and Windows 7 and some other excellent products., In light of Apple's over the top antics, my disdain for Microsoft has seriously lightened., Intel now manages to wow me so often that my jaw regularly stays locked open., I still consider myself an AMD fanboy and really hope in my heart they will return to dominance, but until they do I will run Intel processors., I hate Macs because I see the kind of idiocy in this article diaplayed everywhere I go and it rubs a raw nerve with me., This article is the kind of tripe I would expect over at Mac Life where the opinions have a good reason to be biased.When Apple up and decides to do something I can get excited about my opinion will change., Infact, my opinion already has changed., I had a much better opinion of Apple when I didnt know anything about them and I was just hoping that anybody with some clout would come along and give Microsoft a run for their money., I really hoped Apple would do that., Sometimes getting what you wished for is worse than what you have, as is the case with Apple., But Maximum PC is my refuge., I started reading this magazine because it is notorious for getting into the nuts and bolts of things, for breaking down all the technical aspects of technology, for delving deeply into specs and performance numbers that only the geek of geeks could understand., Side by side comparisons of products were a very regular thing (and still are thankfully)., There were few mentions of Linux (although I wished for more) and even less of Macs (although I wished for none)., The occasional smartphone review was a true rarity., I realize the market has changed drastically since I started reading and much of this is now relevant, but thats all the more reason for some good traditional nuts and bolts analysis, some side by side comparisons and benchmarks., These recent Apple and iPhone articles seem to be a break from the norm., I still love you guys, but come on., Help us to understand these emerging markets in our industry of choice instead of seemingly trying to covertly indoctrinate us., I expect more from you guys., Login or register to post commentsThank you

The iPhone 4 is the best pocket computer available today., It has more and better apps than any other device, and runs them very well., Even though the Android Market is growing by leaps and bounds and Android offers a few unique benefits like free Google Navigation, Apple's App Store is still where the action is: it has better apps in almost every single category, most importantly games., I'm not going to go into the iPhone's base software features., They've been well covered all over the Web., Rest assured it has a great Web browser (without Flash), support for various email accounts, multitasking (new with iOS 4) and al the basic features you expect from a modern smartphone., I'd like to see Apple integrate social networking directly into their address book the way HTC has been doing on Google Android phones, but apps are available for each social network you're on., The iPhone 4's Apple A4 processor seems to run faster than the iPhone 3GS, but slower than the iPad., On the BenchTest and BenchMark benchmarking apps and the Google V8 Javascript browser tests, the iPhone 4 came in up to 40 percent faster than the 3GS, often almost evenly spaced between the 3GS and the iPad., The iPhone 4 matched the iPad on the SunSpider JavaScript benchmark and on the time it took to launch Need for Speed Undercover, a complex game., Some of that extra horsepower will be necessary to drive higher-res graphics on the new screen., Some of it makes multitasking smoother?and multitasking was indeed smooth, as I played Pandora music over AT&T's 3G network while updating my TweetDeck., But a lot of it will just keep the iPhone app experience feeling silky smooth., The faster processor definitely improves the Internet experience., I clocked consistently faster speeds on Speedtest.net with an iPhone 4 than with a 3GS sitting next to it (as long as I wasn't holding the 4 in a "death grip")., While the 3GS ranges from 700-1800 kbps down, the iPhone 4 consistently downloaded in the 2-2.5 Mbps range., In real-life use, that meant Google maps loaded noticeably faster and Web pages appeared faster on the iPhone 4 than on the 3GS., I couldn't test the phone's new tethering capability, though I found it buried in the Settings menu., When I tried to activate it, it told me to call AT&T., Apple ships some new apps to go with their new phone and new iOS 4., I have mixed feelings about iBooks., It's a beautifully designed ebook and PDF reader, with an integrated store, the ability to sync bookmarks with an iPad, and a great visual bookshelf metaphor for paging through your books., But the 3.5-inch screen doesn't display all that many words, which means you may be flipping pages almost frantically; a phone form factor just isn't the best one for reading books., The roomy iPad is much better., I loaded some complex PDFs into iBooks, and I was happy to see them render clearly., A complex bus map took a few seconds to appear but then did so., A 44-page cell phone manual crashed iBooks once, but I didn't have any problems after I restarted the app., Here, especially, the 960-by-640 screen came in handy?tiny text was very, very sharp., The iPhone 4's other flagship app is iMovie, and we'll have a full review of that soon., Suffice it to say iMovie is more powerful, and more complex than any other iPhone app I've seen so far, and its interface has more than a five-minute learning curve., On the other hand, it outputs complete movies from raw video you recorded with your iPhone, complete with introductions and transitions., Multimedia Performance
The iPhone is still the best music and video player in the phone world, as long as you get along with iTunes., I personally like iTunes, and I find its simple yet comprehensive media organization and syncing abilities to be the absolute top of the class., Video playback is especially enhanced by the new screen., An HD TV show downloaded from iTunes was distinctly sharper on the iPhone 4 than on the 3GS., Music sounded clear through headphones plugged into the 3.5-mm jack and through Altec Lansing BackBeat ($99.99-129.99, ) Bluetooth stereo headphones, with one minor caveat: the fast-forward and rewind buttons on Bluetooth headsets don't work., The iPhone 4's lightning-fast camera is the best I've seen on a cameraphone so far., Compared to shots from the Motorola Droid X ($299.99, ) and HTC EVO 4G ($299.99, ) in 5-megapixel mode, the iPhone 4 shows less fringing, sharper edges, and better balance of wide dynamic range., Low-light shots still fall below point-and-shoot digital camera standards, and you get some softness, but they're very good for a cameraphone., The flash is also unusually bright, for a cameraphone., The iPhone can't replace a good point-and-shoot like a Canon Powershot for still images?but for video, it just might., This is a downright excellent video recorder, taking very sharp movies in 720p (1280-by-720) format at 30 frames per second., The iPhone's movie mode easily matches or beats the quality I've seen from Flip cameras., The elements which would give me pause would be the iPhone's lack of optical zoom and image stabilization., As with all cameraphones, it's hard to hold very still for long periods of time, so videos tend to wobble., And it's impossible to expect optical zoom in a thin phone, but people often want it in a camcorder (especially if they're trying to record kids' sports from the sidelines.)

You can also take photos and videos with the front-facing camera, of course, but they're 640-by-480 resolution at best., Conclusions
Apple will tell you at great length that they aren't about specs, they're about "experiences." They still offer the easiest smartphone OS to use, with the best app library and the best PC syncing experience., And some of the iPhone 4's hardware features show why you need to look at quality rather than numbers., The phone's 5-megapixel camera may not have as many megapixels as others' 8-megapixel cameras, but it takes better pictures., On the other hand, the 960-by-640 screen has many more pixels than an 854-by-480 screen, but the difference isn't as dramatic as it sounds., The iPhone 4 is far and away the best smartphone on AT&T, but that's in part because AT&T doesn't yet offer any of the Google Android-powered "super phones" you see on other carriers., If you're faithful to Verizon, for instance, the HTC Incredible and Motorola Droid X are perfectly good enough to prevent you from jumping over to AT&T for this iPhone; if you're a happy Sprint customer, the HTC EVO 4G is an excellent device., None of these phones are far and away better than the others?they're all tough competitors., The iPhone faithful are reading this review to determine whether I'm a "fanboy" of something or other and to justify their purchases., I'm not a fanboy of anything specific, and their purchases are justified., The iPhone 4 is pretty great, in many ways., But one size doesn't fit all., There is no perfect, end-all device., Google could learn a whole lot from Apple about how to encourage game developers, and Apple could learn from HTC and Motorola about antenna design., The iPhone 4 deserves its place in the pantheon of cell-phone gods, but as part of a distinguished group, not as a single overlord., Compare the iPhone 4 with several other mobile phones side by side., Sorry, no posts matched your criteria., Categories		
No categories, So cool!Now the iPhone 4 is going to get hand!, wind up!yeah, Apple comes through once again with a nice package!this review is very comprehensive, all-through., For the multitasking is what as the top attraction, the Fast app switching, Task completion, Background audio and VoIP, Background GPS are all tempting, perhaps can more detailed.Maybe the good review need to be compared with, but seems from the features, there are none of the other phone can compared with, the HTC Evo 4G maybe it's competitor, but they are different I believe.Now just waiting for 24th!, AS the iPhone 4 high-definition video clips(via: http://ifunia.com/iphone-column/new-iphone-hd-s..., ), watch video on IPhone 4 must be cool and amazing!, I've been looking for a good program to Convert videos or rip DVD movies for the iPhone 4 and i think iFunia iPhone 4 Video Converter is the one which worth trying ., My special iphone4 is gonna love it :), People say the Droid has clearer sound, but nobody???s serving apple iCrepes outside the Droid store like these people did at the Apple store in Phoenix., Dtyda June 27, 2010   10:27 pmReply, DVD to iphone 4 converter suite is really very easy to use ,easy to download and install, i like

Don?t ask us how but we got have the latest iteration of Apple?s coveted smartphone in our office for review., The iPhone 4 represents a much more significant upgrade since its last jump from the 3G to the 3GS, and is marked with several hardware added to iPhone improvements., The phone has been plagued by antenna issues and screen problems, but that has not dampened the buying public- ., with With 3 million units sold to date, let?s let us see what ?s all the fuss is about shall we?, Design
The iPhone 4 retains the basic design of the previous iPhones, a brick of electronics, and a screen with a central button., However this iteration, with dimensions at 115.2 x 58.6 x 9.3 mm, is much more squarish, has a flat back and is covered in scratch-free plate glass, front and back., The phone?s borders are covered with aluminium, and still follows Apple?s standard for aesthetics., The phone is has a nice, dense weight to it, but it is by no means light, at 137g., Apple has coined their 3.5 inch HD screen, ?Retina Display?., The screen displays 960x360 pixels and it does display some clear eye candy., Apple plugs it as a crystal clear screen which the user can look at from any angle without losing any of the quality., One thing we do agree with Apple, is the Retina Display does display some eye candy on screen, watching movies on the screen is a joy as well., The ubiquitous home central button remains, on the left spine, it still retains the volume rocker but it is spilt into two buttons, the vibrate trigger is there as well., The top of the phone has the 3.5mm headphone jack and the power button., Meanwhile, the Apple charger dock is at the bottom., The microSIM slot is located on the right side of the phone, and will require a smidge more strength to eject said slot., The front-facing camera allows photos and video calls (Apple is calling it FaceTime)., FaceTime is only does Wi-Fi calls right now, but Apple claims a software update will enable 3G calls soon., The battery pack is increased 16% to deal with further hardware upgrades, and multitasking which comes with iOS4., But out testing shows similar battery life before we had to charge the phone again., Apple retained the same memory size for the iPhone 4, at 16 or 32 GB., There is also a 1GHz processor, which should translate into extra speeds., The iPhone 4 has a gyroscope to increase the accuracy of the accelerometer control and the maps function., Finally, we threw in the ?death grip? test, where we did not experience signal degradation from our carrier., Apple also promised free bumpers to those who purchased the iPhone, which you have to register via an iPhone app called Case Program., After choosing your bumper, Apple will send you the Bumper free of charge., iOS4
The iPhone 4 is installed with the iOS4 on the get go, Apple has been touting multitasking as the iOS4?s major upgrade, users will be able to switch back and forth between applications without having to shut down the app entirely to access another one., You can control iPod music with the multitasking bar, without leaving the homescreen., iOS4 allows multiple accounts now, and it can either as viewed unified as a one long thread or we can choose to see our Hotmail or Gmail as a separate account., Emails can now be organised by thread, much like a text conversation., Within the thread, the amount of unread messages is displayed., Other upgrades include a refurbished UI, where the apps and the wallpaper are spruced up., iOS4 allows the screen?s portrait to be locked as well, so you can read lying down, without the screen going in all directions., iBooks comes free on the App store, it logs in with your App store/iTunes account., iBooks is similar to the iPad?s app, swiping left and right will turn the page., You can also read your books horizontally., A quick scroll at the bottom, will allow quick jumping to your favourite page or chapter., There is also the ability to bookmark your pages, highlight words or sentences, and search them through a free dictionary, or Google or Wikipedia., To address the antenna issues, iOS 4.0.1 will give the iPhone 4 a curved display, which will display a more accurate representation of the signal received., iOS4 retains functionality like Spotlight, MMS, voice control, and Cut, Copy and Paste., The 

The UI remains easy to use, and with further upgrades to make it even more useful., Connectivity
The iPhone 4 has quad-band connectivity options (850/900/1800/1900 MHz), 7.2Mbps HSDPA, GRPS, EDGE, Bluetooth 2.1 and Wi-Fi., Camera 
The iPhone 4 has a 5 megapixel camera and has a LED flash, with a digital zoom., Photo quality is above average, and would give point and shoot camera?s a run for their money, especially with the handiness of a mobile device., The iPhone 4 retains the ability to tap-to-focus., The tap-to- focus works very much like an autofocus camera., The front facing camera shoots at 640x480 pixels, and is able to record video as well., The phone?s camera sees a video recorder option, recording at 720p@30fps., The quality is pretty good and allows video editing or trimming as Apple calls it., like copy and paste, there are grab points that can be pulled from one point to the other., You still cannot cut the middle and paste front and back parts together., But, now you can save your edit copy without overwriting the previous one., Verdict 

Everything old is new again with the iPhone 4, the device is follows the proven designs of previous iPhones but spruced up with a HD screen and video call camera., The iOS4 remains the bedrock of the device, with ease of use in mind., Apple is slowly piling on the hardware, but they are still behind compared to one or two bleeding cutting edge phones like the HTC EVO 4G., There is also the antenna issue, which depends on who you want to listen to, represents either a catastrophic disaster for the phone or a minor speed bump., The bumper Apple?s handing out is a stopgap measure, but from what we?ve seen it will not hinder the phone or its functions., All in all, it is still a good smartphone to have, with better hardware, a proven UI, and still remains a beautiful device., We don?t see Apple reducing the pricing for the iPhone 4, so we are expecting a similar contract ? RM 2,400 onward with a commitment fee., The iPhone 4 is expected to arrive by the end of August, with both Maxis and DiGi announcing its availability., Related Article :

 Submit url, All Rights Reserved., First iPhone 4 Reviews Mostly Sing Its Praises, Just when you thought a few lucky customers beat the rest of the world to getting an iPhone 4, some technology journalists with early access to the device just published their reviews., Apple typically handpicks a select group of publications to get early review units, and the first round of reviews comes from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Engadget and others., The reviewers agreed that the iPhone 4?s hardware is state-of-the-art industrial design., However, they debated about whether the handset solves the iPhone?s biggest recurring problem: handling phone calls on the overloaded AT&T network., Priced at $200 for the 16-GB model and $300 for the 32-GB model, the iPhone 4 hits stores Thursday (though a few lucky pre-order customers are getting theirs as early as today)., Excerpts from the early reviews are as follows:
Josh Topolsky, Engadget:
The big question is obviously whether or not this fixes or helps with the constant dropped calls iPhone users on AT&T?s network have gotten used to., Well in our testing, we had far, far fewer dropped calls than we experienced on our 3GS., Let?s just say that again: yes, the iPhone 4 does seem to alleviate the dropped call issue., Walt Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal:
In both hardware and software, it is a major leap over its already-excellent predecessor, the iPhone 3GS., It has some downsides and limitations? most important, the overwhelmed AT&T network in the U.S., which, in my tests, the new phone handled sometimes better and, unfortunately, sometimes worse than its predecessor., Xeni Jardin, Boing Boing:
The fourth incarnation of Apple?s iPhone is an incrementally improved, familiar device ? not a new kind of device, as was the case with the recent introduction of iPad?., Apple?s focus on improvement is as much key to the quality of its products as innovation., But there?s one flaw it doesn?t eliminate: the unreliable quality of calls placed over AT&T, which remains the iPhone?s only U.S., David Pogue, The New York Times:
With the iPhone 4, Apple tried to relieve the wigginess [of phone calls]., Sound is much better on both ends of the call, thanks in part to a noise-canceling microphone and an improved audio chamber (which also helps speakerphone and music sound)., The stainless-steel edge band is now part of the antenna., The new phone is also better at choosing the best channel for connecting with the cell tower, even if?s not technically the strongest one., (Ever had four bars, but a miserable connection?, Then you get it.)
Edward Baig, USA Today:
Cutting through the hype, Apple has given longtime diehards, and first-time iPhone owners, plenty to cheer about., Brian is a Wired.com technology reporter focusing on Apple and Microsoft., He's also writing a book about the always-connected mobile future called Always On (publishing April 2011 by Da Capo)., Follow @bxchen and @gadgetlab on Twitter., Tags: Apple, iphone 4, reviews, blog comments powered by Disqus, There are new privacy options available for the new iPhone and other iDevices updated to iOS4., If one chooses not to disclose some personal information for iAds, she can opt out at http://oo.apple.com, There are new privacy options available for the new iPhone and other iDevices updated to iOS4., If one chooses not to disclose some personal information for iAds, she can opt out at http://oo.apple.com, There are new privacy options available for the new iPhone and other iDevices updated to iOS4., If one chooses not to disclose some personal information for iAds, she can opt out at http://oo.apple.com, They are indeed!, Apple news is always last years news!, Life can be so much more simple: Video call with Fring on Nokia 5800 and Skype on PC: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GjfMO9lziE, They are indeed!, Apple news is always last years news!, Life can be so much more simple: Video call with Fring on Nokia 5800 and Skype on PC: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GjfMO9lziE, They are indeed!, Apple news is always last years news!, Life can be so much more simple: Video call with Fring on Nokia 5800 and Skype on PC: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GjfMO9lziE, They are indeed!, Apple news is always last years news!, Life can be so much more simple: Video call with Fring on Nokia 5800 and Skype on PC: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GjfMO9lziE, I think it's time I got one!, It would replace my gen 2 ipod touch, olympus digital camera, and reliable but aging LG phone all in one device., Seems so worth it!, hows the video hd quality n other new features.., no one yet reviewed on tht !!, There are quite a few devices out there that deserve this kind of attention as well., Wonder why they never get it., Best device out there., FaceTime works all the time every time with no hoops to waste time to make it work., They should rename this hack-writing SHILL site Wired-4Apple., They should rename this site Wired-4-Apple, since all this lousy site is is a stealth arm of Apple shilling., This is lacking in every way ., A phone which cant handle a phone call.its like a car without a steering wheel.it has  very minimum multitasking., some other phones u can have open 8 browser windows., I can hardly call this multitaskingApple gave the phone to selected few.I am sure if they wrote a bad review they wont be selected next yr., You know that when the new Nokia N8 releases, or the Droid X, or the first WM7 phone, none of them will get this kind of great press., I guaran-fricking-tee it., Because the companies that sell them aren't as good at marketing them ?, There is no conspiracy theory stuff going on here, just plain old business., They should just go ahead and name the comments section for virtually any Apple-related article ?Douche-nozzle trollboy land?., You idiots should just get a life and confine your comments to Nokia articles, because, you know, they're just so AWESOME!, What's so hard to understand ?, How many Android devices since then, 50+ ?, A new iPhone IS news, however uncomfortable that makes you feel., I'm not saying it's not news., I'm saying that all these rags gloss over the deficiencies and give Apple a lot of undue praise., And I wasn't just saying Android., Soon we will have the first WM7 and Symbian^3 phones, and I know that the praise will not be so forthcoming., Gentlemen, start your engines ? on your mark, get set ? FLAME WIRED FOR NOT BEING ANTI APPLE!, WM7 phones will draw PLENTY of attention., Just as the various Zunes did., They were all very well reviewed, including here, on Wired., (O noze ? Wired is full of Microsoft fanboyz!), Typical press crap over an over hyped over rated device.The tech press has to get updated and sync up with reality.As many others have mentioned, the new iPhone is no break through like the first one wasThere are many better alternatives, especially considering the superiority of the ANDROID OS over the iOS which merely plays catch up?
Whatever., Because other phones have better cameras and have an HDMI out which the iPhone doesn't; ), You unlucky americans!, Here in minion Portugal and the rest of Europe the iPhone works perfectly., Isn't 'dropped calls' a network issue, not a hardware issue?, Once again Apple teaches other handset makers it doesn't matter who did it first, its who does it best., EVO has front facing camera, but the thing is a POS to use., So yea, say you have it, but don't say you can use it cause we all know its crap in a plastic container., You can't polish a turd HTC!, Go ahead and name me a device that does it as well., Please submit only one device., Fandroids like to rattle off multiple phones that all do as much or more than the iPhone as if by magic you have all of those functions from various phones at your fingertips., And be careful which phone you choose cause I'm gonna tell you why its a POS as all Android phones are., I'll wait right here., Just tired of ?free? press Guys writing reviews based on their stock portfolio instead of reality and based on hopes and non conclusive meaning less words like ?magical? and ?retina display? instead of facts and statistics., Apple haters yowling in the alley brings to a close another day on the Internet..Spay and neuter your pets, people., How about this, genius? if those phones sell 600,000 their first day, or indeed ever, they'll get coverage., It's not bias., Nobody is buying that crap., And I'm guessing most of the yapping bitches who are bellyaching over this Apple press aren't buying any of those ?other? gadgets either., If you don't like Apple products, don't buy Apple products., But a whole hell of a LOT of other people are buying the shit out of Apple products., Not because Wired gives them ?free? coverage, but first and foremost because their products do not suck., ?Wired-4Apple? sounds exactly like a domain name a Windows user would consider ideal., Windows users are some of the tin-earingest motherfuckers on earth., Let's give credit where credit is due., Apple doesn't provide all the features, but the features it does include are rock solid and appeal to 99% of the consumers (geeks and hackers not included)., quest offers free wifi setup with internet subscription, comcast does not., this is because their service is greatly inferior., it's called a selling point., android phones are great at looking good on paper (spec sensationalism)., there's a lot more to taking a good picture than megapixel count., claiming ?other? phones have better cameras without even having used the iphone's new camera is obnoxious., ps, why would i even want to connect my phone to my tv?, i can just get the new mac mini and view anything on my phone on my tv via the cloud., if you're an android fan, i'm sure you've heard of it., why are you reading this article?, go suckle from phandroid or something., you're post is the result of a moron spending too much time on his computer., You must be another one of them kiss-asses., Listen rabidcb, I can't understand why you and so many others take this so seriously., I have nothing wrong with Apple's products., they are well made, relatively user-friendly, etc., What I do have a problem with is the stereotypical App-Hole that uses them., I have never owned an Apple product simply because of people like you who blindly follow this company and its elitist and anti-competitive business practices., So get over yourself, and enjoy your iPhone 4., But stop kissing Jobs' ass, cuz he sure as HELL won't give you a discount., So basically, the phone is secondary because AT&T sucks., Gotta love Walt Mosberg., It's a phone., Right off the bat, browser windows have absolutely nothing to do with multitasking., The iPhone can have open as many browser windows as the user desires, but that's neither here nor there., The multitasking solution set up by Apple will give 99% of the population what they need., Since two windows for different programs won't be open, the need for ?true? multitasking is non-existent., VoIP, background audio, GPS, and uploading are the real multitasking features that anyone ever needs on a phone, and fast-app switching will give the perception of multitasking without wasting CPU or battery., Basically, those who hate Apple will attack Apple anytime, even if that means they have to say ?Why won't Apple implement a feature that wastes battery life and CPU, even if it does have the same effect for the end-user., Apple is screwing us again.?
I'm a dev, and I have both an N1 and a 3GS (which I'm trading for the 4 tomorrow), so I get why the computer savvy love Android., It's an awesome system which I prefer in some aspects to iOS., There are some legitimate gripes with Apple that we have (withholding features just to have something to sell next time around) but these other pointless arguments make Android users look petty and ignorant., Something that we have to face is that iOS is the more polished OS, that is better suited for the majority of the population, because for every feature it offers, it performs flawlessly., I love Android in all it's nerdy customizable greatness, but it will always be a beta OS., That's what makes it great, yet makes it second-rate., have you ever been in a porn shop, seen someone you know, and then started bashing porn?, i would get one if it wasn't on AT&T., I'm sick and tired of my 3GS dropping calls, 3G slow as hell?you get the idea., Network problems are too great for me to upgrade right now, I'll wait until they open up the market if ever., AT&T is GSM, so it's the same iPhone as the one sold in Europe (well, you unlucky Europeans don't yet have the 4G  )., It's just that AT&T's network sucks in most places., Here's to hoping that MS, Google, Skype, and iChat(most certainly) adopt the open Facetime standard for their products., Naa, I just don't like people who scour the net looking for pro-Apple articles only to complain Apple is getting too much attention, when in fact it is they who are giving Apple all the attention., You mean the iPhone is priced too high for the common consumer?, Or you mean only people with a certain income level can sign up with AT&T?, Or do you mean that the common man is too ignorant to use the iPhone cause it is too confusing?, You must be a freetard to think that only elitist can only purchase solidly engineered products., Most freetards think everything should be free, my goodness., What is news is that it took a company like Apple to show all the handset makers how to produce a functioning phone that actually extends the battery life despite adding a ton of features., This is bang-for-your-buck engineering at its best, the rest are pretending., Yea, Android looks superior., I like the way it chews through your battery life in half the time the previous version did., I mean, that is advancement at its best., Maybe next year Apple can cut the battery life down in half., Hell, iPhone 4 actually extended the battery life from iPhone 3GS, what is Apple thinking., Those lazy ass engineers need to wake up and find a way to one up Android., And here is why: junk, junk and soon to be junk., it's just what I do not expect from a phone review, how good it is handling the bad provider infrastructure?we don't face problems like that here in Switzerland with the contracted providers., maybe apple should stop using at&t as their main provider and move to other countries for iphone's r&d., we have 2 providers here that support iphones and their services are just great when it comes to basic usage as calls and texting., in fact, emailing and browsing on iphones are most of the times just amazing., seemed like at&t is stalling iphone's progressions with their problems, as my fren from the states says, and prevent those where mobile service are just amazing, from utilizing full mobility features of the device., I don?t need to scour the net (or more specifically Wired.com) to see these kinds of comments about Apple., So you admit that the Apple is priced too high., And that, you believe, the iPhone is too difficult to use for the ?common man.?  I always thought Apple prided itself on user-friendliness., Therefore, if it?s creating a device that is difficult to use and expensive for the average consumer, would that not represent a company that is elitist., And in truth, I don?t think anything should be free; hard work pays off., And this assertion of being a ?freetard? is not only a retarded label, but decidedly proves my point that you as an Apple consumer  have begun to appear to be an iDouche., You have proven also that you take these comments personally and are giving the appearance of being a kiss-ass., And in reply to @otterriffic I do not own them, but I have quite a bit of experience with them, because my department in college uses them., I could have mentioned that I guess., You don't own any Apple products., So doesn't that sort of invalidate your statement about how other devices deserve this sort of attention?, You wouldn't know, would you?, They don't need the Facetime., They just need to design some apps that use the front-facing camera., Depends on who you ask.Apple: 'Definitely AT&T's fault!'AT&T: 'That's the faulty Apple hardware!', Apple is only still in business because microsoft HAD to have some competition., Until a few years ago they made shitty computers, then they made a shitty music player (it doesn't even do random, shuffle?, F that)., How that has brought them to where they are now seems like a deal made to the devil., And, sorry I do like to be able to customize my damn phone, they are just now letting people use a different wallpaper than just black., I will never be apart of the trendy crowd, it's kinda weird seeing adults act like they did in junior high about trends., I still don't have guess jeans or jordan shoes either.That and why the hell do people on these sites say FAIL all the time?, That just sounds so queer., I doubt it will even be newsworthy., I mean, look to wired as an example, they are the holy grail of tech, a quarter before the iPhone launch and there were 2 or 3 articles a week (being conservative), and that is for the 4th version., Now, lets take windows mobile 7., I haven?t seen a single article on what changes windows is making in their phone OS., well, we know where you are, you are in bed with Steve Jobs., Hope it isn?t too crowded in there., They?re phones but they?re Magically delicious!, if ignorance is bliss, then you must be the happiest flamer ever., why don't you let bygones be bygones and stick to posting about the greatness that is the iPhones 4?, I'm sure facetime is fantastic and seamless, but i can also appreciate the fact that the evo 4 allows ppl to chat face to face with skype users with a web cam, as well as other evo 4g users., Two points emerge: First, as is normal with any company or technology ,there is always the guy that always will says that product A ,B or C from is better than all the rest., It's a little bit like soccer in the world., Second as i'm from Portugal all the major carriers sells the iphone, and we don't have that dropped calls problem., And about the 4G, the first preliminary test will come in the first semester of 2011., Must be very dark and lonely in that room?., (And true)., Congrats, you have money to spend to compensate for things that your iCan?t won?t do, but for the rest of us, who have no money to waste on silly little toys, we have to buy phones that have multiple uses., I understand WIRED like to kiss Steve Jobs ass but if you buy any of Apple's products you'll understand why all those praises exist.- Quality of hardware: Check the macbook unibody enclosure, size of the Airport Express, iMac (great computer inside a monitor), iPad speed, etc., It's hard to see a crap product from that company.- Software: Apple has a great user interface., Complains against Apple are always related to price and fanboys., heh, when people tell me facetime is the first real solution makes me facepalm., that's what they said., i fricking hate AT&T Apple get a better carrier, what's your issue?!, Pity the media player side of things hasn't moved forward in about five years., You can't even delete songs or export ratings., Can't even play Divx., And don't get me started on having to manage it with iTunes on only one computer or risk having everything deleted., Steve Jobs FFS, give us drag-and-drop file management, expandable storage, document folder navigation and let us expand the codecs., Heck, charge us more if that's all that gives you an erection., Just enough with everything being about selling us more DOS-era apps through your god-awful iTunes store., as i say below, I have used the products., I am not against them, they are good products., remember when they weren't though., The attitude at Apple was still the same hubris, as if by owning an apple product one was somehow entitled to be arrogant., but price is also not my complaint., these phone plans are perfectly reasonable., I paid about the same for my phone., think about it in terms of computers., If I have 1200 to spend on a laptop, and I can get a Mac or PC based product, first, like most people I will see what I need from the device, then I will see who has the best price., my current laptop is every bit as capable as any Mac, costs 500 less, and gave me the option to buy more peripherals and software., So it isn't that I can't afford it, more like I won't pay for it., HTC EVO 4G as in 4G something the iPhone 4 will never have., Suck on that!, It's probably because they don't actually deserve it., Looks like there are a lot of shit-disturbers here along with the kiss-asses., you unlucky europeans!, here in japan we don't even have a gsm network, and the iphone works perfectly., got 3g?, haha, actually we're stuck with softbank who somehow manage to suck worse than at&t., I guess it depends on what you want the device to do well., whether it is apples fault or AT&T, I can name multiple devices on other carriers that do it better., and that is what this device is first and foremost, a phone, I mean, it's part of the name., It is apple's fault as much as it is AT&Ts fault that they have to put up with shitty service., Windows Mobile gives the highest level of customization, followed by Android., yeah winmo may have a lot of problems, but customization isn't one of them., Even if you jailbreak that iPhone, it still won't allow you to do the things you can do with a winmo phone, and you don't even have to break any EULA to do it., Android, hands down., turn by turn navigation from the factory?, No map update necessary?, Apple didn't even support MMS until about a year ago, and I quit using it and went back to using my email to send pictures because half of the time the message didn't go through., carrier fault or apples, doesn't matter cause again, apple chose ATT as its horse., beauty is subjective, but iPhone hands down wins the beauty pageant., depends on the device and not the os, but there are winmo devices with better/bigger screens and android devices with better/bigger screens., surfing the net on 4.3? instead of 3.5? is simply amazing, pixels per inch completely not withstanding, cause with the bigger device, I can hold it farther away from my face, I hold an iPhone close to my face out of necessity, and that is why they need to cram more pixels per inch., I could continue to go on, but I won't, because you will discredit every single point I make that I don't agree with Apple being the best., Speaking of the 1st gen loyal phone owners, when I went to upgrade with itunes 9.2 I to 3.2., the upgrade started off nicely, but wound up where I could not install the OS on the iphone unless the phone was registered., I use my 1st gen phone as an ipod (it has no simcard in it) since I have a 3GS for my regular phone so how is this suppose to work?, I was over in an iphone forum and one of the members was having the same problem as I though he did say he talked to an Apple engineer and they are working on a fix., It never ceases to amaze me how angry commenters still get over Apple versus everybody else., They are just tools!, Lighten up, people, go outside in the sun smile and say hello to somebody., Does it matter?, Apple chose to use ATT and they choose to continue to use ATT., You'd think that someone would have put a clause in the contract that says ?if your network sucks, we can take our ball and go somewhere else? I am hard pressed to believe that Apple would have not ability to do anything other than shrug and say ?network issue, not our problem?., That is very lame and exactly one of the reasons I am leaving my iPhone after 2 years of service and headed over to a different carrier and different phone., :rolleyes: it works all the time every time with no hoops so long as you are on a wifi network., I have plenty of devices that can do video chat over a wifi network., so what if my laptop is more cumbersome than a phone, I don't want to do video chat in a coffee shop anyway., that aren't limited to only doing it over a wifi network., perhaps he read the article, as I did, in hopes of some real reviews of the device, but rather was stuck reading Apple propaganda, he was disappointed and wanted to voice his displeasure., Yea, I especially like how you have to press the mic button when you want to talk and if the other person has their mic button pressed while you are talking, he/she doesn't hear you., Skype on 3G for the EVO does not work, so don't pretend it does., You have to use Fring., To practice using Fring, go down to your nearest Toys R Us and purchase a set of walkie talkies because this is the experience you will get., Again, Apple does it right and seamless., Don't make excuses for HTC., Lets not even get into the battery life of an EVO., HTC knows they don't need to sell you well engineered hardware, all they have to do is pack as many features in that brick as they can, working or not, and Fandroids will eat it up and dance around that they have a feature rich phone despite the fact the thing is a poorly engineered brick., I've seen a couple of android updates now, and uh yeah, my batter life was never ?chewed? in half., My phone will last me two days the way I use it, but it's a non issue for me, it's tethered to my laptop at home every night so I can use the connection?, you?re stupid., ?Well in our testing, we had far, far fewer dropped calls than we experienced on our 3GS.?
I'm on Sprint, have had my Evo for 3 weeks now (got 25 hours out of my last charge, btw), and have experienced zero dropped calls., Settling for ?far, far fewer? really makes it sound like it was a common occurrence with the previous iPhone, and even ?fewer? with this new one doesn't seem acceptable to me., It has to be frustrating to not be able to make a phone call on a cell phone., Great product + great marketing = everybody wants it., This is probably how Christianity got started!, But, reading this comment thread?haters don't get it., Why would you read a review for a product you DON'T want?, That's like writing Ashton Kutcher and trying to convince him to break up with his older lady friend., That's like reading a review for a dish you don't like and trying to convince other people (who love it) that they're deluding themselves., Seriously, what do you care?, What do you GAIN?, There's no arguing in matters of taste., Me, I LOVE apple pie., I love the promise of it, the smell of it ? the sight of it., I love reading about it and anticipating it, fantasizing about it being super satisfying and baked just right., Simple: every apple pie I've ever had has been delicious!, I'm eating one now!, The last thing people like me want to hear about is why you don't like it., Let me love it!, Haters: go find something you love and hype it up., I might be wrong but I think the article was about iPhones., I?m not sure you can get a phone that does the same thing for 500 dollars less $199 or $299., I might be wrong but I think the article was about iPhones., I?m not sure you can get a phone that does the same thing for 500 dollars less $199 or $299., I'll be sure to inform my iPods that they don't do random play., Won't they be surprised!, I wonder where the name ?iPod Shuffle? comes from?, Silly name for a product that doesn't shuffle., And no doubt one of the assholes who voted for Obama., And no doubt one of the assholes who voted for Obama., And no doubt one of the assholes who voted for Obama., Flag as Offensive, read through each one of them (got a little boring after the 3rd one or so..with everyone saying the same thing)., Liked engadget's video samples (esp., with facetime) the most., I think facetime will be a growing theme in the apple ecosystem over the next 5-10 years., At first I thought, video calling is pointless who wants to do that, but I think it will grow and become more popular as it becomes more reliable and easy to use., Down the road it may become the default form of voice communication (given enough people have access to facetime and mobile networks can handle it)., I expect facetime using iphone to mac and to ipad will occur (down the road) only reinforcing the leverage apple has with its phone/computer/ipad ecoystem., Flag as Offensive, I am Skype user since its beta program., Also I started using Video chat first., Yes at the beginning it will be fun and everyone will try it, but fairly quickly it will become more problem then fun., Even if Apple puts the best camera instead of piece of shit camera (it is not Apples fault) they have now the live video would be bad because the bad lighting., And let me tell you most women will not tolerate to been seen like that., Just remember how wired Steve Jobs face looked because of the fish-eye lens?, Then comes all other problem like are you dressed for video chat., I can take a phone call at any time, but most people will be disgust if I start video while I am in bet for example., So I disagree that Facetime would become a norm., Most often it would be used between the teens and I will leave to the publics imagination how they going to use it., New word in urban dictionary "s**time"., Flag as Offensive, Video chat is nice when you are far away from relatives, wife/husband, sons and daughters, grandchildren etc., Definitely will never be norm, not only because we don't want to be seen all the time but also because we use phone while doing other stuff., Project Runaway contestants usually talk to their relatives using video chat and they become very emotive with the images., They use a Motorola phone (it's a paid advertisement), but I don't know exactly which model., Flag as Offensive, That is exactly why I use video chat., I am away from my family most of the time, but even my mom will not come in front of the camera if she is not in her best look., My niece is getting 16 y.o., and now she refuses the video chat if she is tired or she has not taken look in the mirror first., Before she did not care., :)

If they use Motorola most likely it is Moto Razr2 V8., It was market failure for Motorola because the iPhone, but it was one of the first phones with working video chat and Linux based OS., Very cool ideas in old body and introduced in wrong time., It almost bankrupted Motorola Mobile devision., Flag as Offensive, "I can't recommend this new iPhone for voice calling"., Interesting., This makes me think that Apple added FaceTime exactly because iPhone can't make voice calls., So my plan is to buy an iPhone just to follow the hipsters and an Android for real-world use., Flag as Offensive, Copy edit: Graf 1 "everyone's" sted "everyones"

Because, like it or not, AT&T belongs to us, therefore requiring the possessive., -----------------

Tomorrow's lesson: they're vs., Get psyched, Jason., Flag as Offensive, read through each one of them (got a little boring after the 3rd one or so..with everyone saying the same thing)., Liked engadget's video samples (esp., with facetime) the most.]
