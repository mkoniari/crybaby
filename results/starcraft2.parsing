"For many this will not be an issue at all, but for some that have fond memories of LAN parties, this might come as a blow"
"There is no reason you could not recreate the LAN party online, but it just isnâ€™t the same, and it leaves you at the mercy of the battle.net servers that you need to sign into each time to play"
"While reviewing this game, lag and problems with battle.net were frequent, but hopefully that is just growing pains for the game as the servers gradually begin to accept the strain of the huge influx of launch day purchasers.The reason that LAN parties are not included is actually somewhat clever and understandable"
"It is also the reason you didnâ€™t see any reviews of the game on the launch day"
"When you play StarCraft II, you are required to authenticate your copy of the game on the battle.net servers in order to verify that you are not pirating the game (the servers did not go active until launch day, which prohibited early reviews)"

"While the campaign is deep and rewarding, it is also just one-third of the story"
"In the campaign you are only allowed to play as the Terrans"
"Blizzard has promised that the Zerg and the Protoss campaigns are coming soon, but both will require purchase"
"Again, an understandable business decision, and one that shouldnâ€™t count too harshly against the game, but it still leaves a bit of a bad taste in your mouth"
"It is hard not to see it as a money grab, even if there are legitimate reasons to withhold the campaigns, and even if it is a reasonable business strategy"
"Still kinda sucks.Despite these minor flaws, StarCraft II is a deep and intuitive game that will please veterans of the series, and allow new players to see what all the hype is about"
"Whether or not it becomes the classic that the predecessor did remains to be seen, but Blizzard has done their job and released a worthy successor, as well what is probably best RTS game made yet.In StarCraft II, it's still the Terrans, Zerg, and Protoss clashing against each other, and you're still mining minerals with SCVs, Drones, and Probes and pulling Vespene Gas from the ground to fuel production"
"It's a classic style of real-time strategy play, one old-school RTS gamers should be very familiar with"
"Compared to the changes Blizzard made between the traditional gameplay of Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness and the hero-based leveling elements of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, StarCraft II feels like a relatively safe play; a game designed to slide in and discreetly supplant its predecessor instead of ruffle the feathers of longtime StarCraft devotees and risk rejection"
"While it's not a revolutionary game, it is one of the most fully featured, expertly designed, and impressively refined real-time strategy experiences on the market"
"Even though at its most basic level a lot of the game is familiar, much has been adjusted"
"In no area is this more apparent than in the single-player campaign"
"Blizzard's decision to split the overall story of StarCraft II into three parts sparked some controversy when it was first announced; basically that means you only get to play as the Terran faction (with a few exceptions) for the solo portion, and must wait until later for the Zerg and Protoss campaigns to be released to see the entirety of the story"
"While that affects some of the impact of the tale, it in no way means you'll be starved for content if all you're looking to do in StarCraft II is play alone"
"There's a huge campaign here that could easily take many hours to play through (depending on your style and level of difficulty)"
"It's all exceedingly well presented, with a totally reworked narrative delivery system, a few instances of choice driving the story, and options for inter-mission upgrades that make it feel like more of an role-playing experience than a series of mission that exist solely to get you ready for the multiplayer"
"Video ReviewUnlike the original game, this time around you won't be staring at the sparsely animated heads of major characters as they bicker and plot on video monitors between missions"
"Instead, Blizzard gives you a detailed world to play around in to give its fictional universe a greater sense of place and atmosphere"
"The action follows along with Jim Raynor, who begins the game as a gruff alcoholic in the process of rebelling against Arcturus Mengsk, the corrupt emperor of the Terran Dominion"
"If you've forgotten the StarCraft storyline or never got around to learning it, then it should be fairly easy to dig into this one, though you're going to miss a lot of references"
"Regardless of your level of exposure to the fiction, it's difficult to ignore the eye-rolling cliches and talk of prophecies being fulfilled, and the overabundance of 1980s action movie-style macho posturing and cheesiness"
"It's all snugly wrapped around the missions though, which makes it easier to look beyond the standard sci-fi trappings and appreciate the detail that's gone into the creation of the character models, the smoothness of the animations, and the amount of character interaction packed into the experience"
"Since missions are bookended by cut-scenes, great voice acting, and rewards, it makes each feel important in its own way, and adds to your motivation to meet every challenge"
"It's something a lot of developers besides Blizzard have difficulty doing in this genre, with their missions often feeling like a string of meaningless, boring tasks"
"Additional narrative is also provided through interactive environments between missions"
"You're able to explore various settings, from a dusty building at the campaign's outset to Raynor's starship, the Hyperion, and beyond as the action continues"
"Eventually the entirety of the game's options and locations are unlocked, letting you flip around to different areas of the ship to talk to major characters or purchase upgrades"
"On top of that, new units are unlocked depending on which mission you choose to take on next, which can be further modified in the upgrade center, adding significant bonuses to each like more effective healing for medics or boosted protection for Marines"
"Because the campaign isn't tied down by the strict rules of multiplayer balance, this also means you'll see a number of favorites return from the original"
"Firebats, Vultures, Goliaths and more can be unlocked and upgraded in the story mode, which is both a great nod to fans and adds more variety for new players"
"It's a system that's constantly giving you new things to play around with and ways to modify what's already available, making progressions more exciting"
"StarCraft in 5 MinutesAs if that wasn't enough, even more options for army customization exist throughout the campaign, including a research system and mercenary units"
"These mercs can be hired by Raynor for a fee, and when deployed in battle serve as elite versions of existing units that are called in instantly"
"It can be great in a bind, and adds to the stable of available fighters when setting up a battle plan"
"Optional objectives in missions call for the collection of Protoss or Zerg research items, which can then be turned in between stages for even more upgrades"
"Along both Zerg and Protoss paths these upgrades exist in pairs - where selecting one locks out the other - meaning you'll have to make permanent decisions about things like whether you want to buff the armor of a Bunker or slap a gun turret on top"
"All these modification systems combined make for a highly customizable campaign experience that's consistently fun because it introduces a steady stream of new content and options, making sure there's always something to look forward to trying out for the first time"
"Customization is a big part of the campaign's appeal, but really the best part is the mission design"
"It's quite a feat for Blizzard to stuff in this many missions and give each a unique feel, but that's exactly what's been done"
"Each can be broken down into basic and familiar escort, commando, defense, and assault types of tasks, but within each of these a special element is always thrown in"
"Sometimes it's a giant wave of fire slowly sweeping across a map spurring you to frequently relocate your base in pursuit of objectives"
"Sometimes it's a see-saw back and forth battle between armies as you vie to capture nodes located around map"
"Sometimes you'll just be in control of a single unit and need to stealth into enemy territory, relying on AI controlled allies to help wipe out detectors so you can snipe, slice and nuke your enemies into submission"
"I'd recommend any seasoned RTS player bump the difficulty to Hard since Normal is pretty easy, but regardless of skill level the game is always fun because the mission objectives are so diverse.Then it's back to your ship to trade in credits, tweak your army, and talk to the crew"
"Considering each character usually has something new to say about each situation, in many cases revealing important or interesting plot points, it's worth hearing everyone out"
"Interacting with characters also helps establish a stronger relationship with them, which can make some of the decisions that eventually need to be made more meaningful"
"Depending on who you choose to side with at the culmination of a few story arcs can have a noticeable effect on what follows, both in terms of the rewards and the fate of the characters"
"Personality is also established through detail in the environment"
"Unlocked units will appear in your ship's armory like trophies on a rack, there's a jukebox sitting in the Cantina filled with a wide selection of songs that meshes well with the kind of good-natured roughness that characterizes Raynor and his crew"
"There's even a newscast that runs new episodes during the entirety of the game that communicates a comedic side-story that would feel more at home in a role-playing game than an RTS"
"Even the menus feel meticulously developed, where descriptions of upgrades are backed up with embedded videos showing exactly what the upgrade does"
"It's a level of production value not often seen in the industry, and one that, as consumers who like being spoiled, is easy to appreciate"
"Video Settings ComparisonOn the subject of the actual story, it takes a little while to get to the interesting stuff"
"No doubt franchise fans will eat it up, but newcomers may be wondering what all the fuss is about while going through the early missions that lack the kind of urgency you would hope when the fate of civilization is in peril"
"By the end, it certainly makes you wish the second installment, called Heart of the Swarm, was available so you could move past dealing with Raynor's personal regrets and vendettas and focus instead of the larger issues facing Terran, Zerg, and Protoss forces"
"It's not all serious, though"
"There's plenty of humor injected into the story, from Blizzard in-jokes like the dancing Night Elf in the Cantina and the Lost Viking arcade game to Marine Tychus Findlay's insistence on smoking cigars inside his suit to the huge range of unit acknowledgements, it's a welcome counterbalance to the grim future all the races will eventually need to face"
"When you've finally exhausted the campaign's content, it's time to head into the multiplayer portion and dive into all the new version of Blizzard's online service, battle.net, has to offer"
"What you'll find is a wide range of options for play, the star of which is the automated league and ladder system that ensures you're playing against someone of roughly comparable skill level"
"Before getting into that, though, if you're new to the game it's worth checking out all the tutorials and information Blizzard packed into battle.net"
"Everything from unit descriptions to tech trees to tutorials on how to play have been included so nobody should feel entirely lost"
"Challenge missions also exist to allow you to more easily get acquainted with how each unit individually matches up against others"
"It's a handy tool for learning that Hellions can burn through groups of infantry or that Siege Tanks aren't the best unit to use against the Immortals' heavy shields"
"It also introduces you to concepts like using heavy units to soak up damage while ranged hit from afar, as well as familiarizes you with important skills like the Sentry's Force Field and Guardian Shield and the Corruptor's ability to enhance damage to air targets"
"Overall it's a great selection of conveniently placed and produced tutorial materials to help disperse the veil of elitist mystique that surrounds this game and let everyone pick it up and discover why it's so entertaining"
"Lost Viking Arcade ShooterOnce you're actually into the multiplayer, there's plenty to do"
"The progression online eases you into competitive play by giving you the option to practice on rush-proof maps before dropping you into placement play"
"Based on the placement results you're then assigned a league and division automatically with the intention of ensuring those you're matched up against are roughly of the same skill level"
"From what I've experienced since launch the system works well, placing me against fairly equal opponents across 1v1 or team games, which can be up to 4v4"
"All statistics are then tracked on battle.net as your position shifts depending on performance"
"Best of all is the replay feature, which allows you to save and relive any match in a convenient fashion"
"During the replay you can fast forward, reverse, and see a variety of statistics from the game including the all-important APM (actions per minute), that represents essentially how fast you are with issuing commands"
"It's an easy way to observe the build orders and see where you went wrong, and serves as yet another useful learning tool to ease in newcomers"
"The catch is you need to connect through battle.net to get in a game, and you unfortunately won't find an option to play over a local area network"
"It's still possible to play with people you know, but you'll have to do so online by adding them to the in-game friends list and setting up a party"
"If, for whatever reason, you're without a reliable internet connection, you can at least log into battle.net offline and play the single-player and AI matches across an enormous number of Blizzard-made maps, though you won't earn Achievements this way"
"Being able to play offline is at least good news considering how many recent products require you to be constantly online even to play by yourself.When you're finally set and ready for competitive play, you'll find one of the most finely tuned traditional real-time strategy experiences on the market"
"Every unit feels useful, every move has an impact"
"Terrans can set up defensive perimeters around their base by building supply depots"
"These can be lowered into the ground to let friendly forces pass, and can serve as a protective wall against rushers as Marines peg would-be invaders with machine gun blasts from safety"
"Memorization and swift reflexes are keys to success in StarCraft II, and knowing exactly what to build when can have dramatic effects on how a match plays out"
"The interaction and counters between the three races are still as entertaining as ever, particularly because of some of the new gameplay additions like the ability for some units to hop between tiers of land"
"Having units that can move between different levels of terrain adds a ton of tactical options that make multiplayer games more dramatic"
"This can be especially brutal in a skilled Terran player's hand that manages to get a group of Reapers together and uses their jump jets to vault past an opponent's defenses and directly assault their resource gatherers to disrupt economic production"
"If the player's micromanagement skills are good enough, it's then possible to direct the fast-moving Reapers away from defenders, then hold off just long enough to fire a volley of shots, pecking away at pursuers as they themselves stay out of harm's way"
"For those playing against Protoss, there's perhaps no feeling more disheartening than establishing a huge army and setting up elaborate defenses only to have a giant group of Colossi waltz up a cliff at the unprotected back of your base and incinerate all that's been built with their devastating twin lasers"
"For whichever strategy you come to think is best in StarCraft II, there's a counter"
"It's just a matter of who can scout and react the fastest to changing conditions"
"Dropping NukesMuch of the experience is going to be familiar to StarCraft fans, but there have been so many additions and tweaks that there's plenty to learn"
"A lot of players have already been figuring things out in the heavily publicized beta that ran for months pre-launch, and continued support in the months ahead can be expected as Blizzard keeps patching and tweaking the already excellent balance"
"On the hardware side of things, it's nice that the game is capable of running on a wide variety of systems (though anyone with a powerful gaming machine will be happy to see the game looks beautiful at Ultra settings, with detailed character models that are especially striking close up during cut-scenes)"
"Attention to detail throughout the rest of the game, like the sparring of the spider mines in Raynor's armory and general level of wear and tear in other environments (the spider web above the Cantina's television and boots hanging from the overhead wires) shows that a lot of thought was put into delivering believable environments"
"When you're actually playing the RTS portion of the game the visuals aren't quite as impressive, but you'll still get to see some great animations as units trot around the landscape with a sense of weight, get scorched by Hellions, dissolved by Roaches, or sliced in half by Zealots.CLOSING COMMENTSBlizzard wasn't trying to do anything drastically different with StarCraft II"
"Much of the core gameplay of the original has been preserved, yet with plenty of tweaks, additional units and new abilities for veteran players to toy with and devise new approaches to competitive battles"
"Anyone intimidated by the notion of playing against live opponents will find a lot to enjoy, with a fantastically presented single-player campaign featuring impressively varied mission design supported by a memorable, though often cheesy, cast of characters"
"Then, if you're feeling courageous, the notion of venturing online is made more appealing by battle.net's automated ranking system that frequently matches you up with opponents of similar skill level"
"It's not a step forward for the genre, exactly, but StarCraft II is still one of the most polished, finely crafted and well presented real-time strategy games available.IGN RATINGS FOR STARCRAFT II: WINGS OF LIBERTY (PC)Rating	Descriptionout of 10	Click here for ratings guide10	PresentationIncredibly high production values throughout, from the cut-scenes to the interface and menus across campaign and multiplayer modes.9.0	GraphicsLooks great on ultra if you've got the power to handle it, and will run on a wide variety of systems.9.0	SoundThe slashes and booms of combat make battle more exciting, and an appropriately epic score backs up the action"

"Awesome cinematics and great voice acting get you involved in the story"
"Element of choice gives campaign lots of replay value"
"Excellent online play featuring three disparate but balanced factions"
"Challenges and practice league ease neophytes into competitive play.The BadSome Battlenet inconveniences"
"Only one campaign.Some sequels radically reinvent what has come before; others simply buff up a formula that already soars"
"To suggest that Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty does only the latter and not the former would be to sell short the fresh ideas and exciting gameplay that makes this superb real-time strategy sequel so enjoyable"
"This package delivers more than simple fun--it serves up incredible amounts of variety, from the cinematic and multifaceted campaign to the competitive and tightly balanced multiplayer"
"You might scoff at the fact that the game only includes a single campaign and, perhaps, at the high price point (the game retails at $59.99; $10 higher than the average PC game)"
"But these are nitpicks, forgivable quibbles in a high-quality game that provides plenty of bang for the buck"
"Starcraft II is the natural next step for the series: it both embraces and updates the core components that made the first game a huge hit while layering on important features that give the game endless replay value, both online and off"
"This is one of the finest real-time strategy games in years, and whether you're new to the genre or have been studying Protoss build orders for the past decade, there's something here to delight you.Firebats versus zerglings: see if you can guess who comes out on top.Comment on this videoWatch this video in High DefThe campaign is the first of many of these delights"
"You may have heard that Starcraft II features only a single campaign: that of the human faction known as the Terrans"
"One of the game's few disappointments is that the other two factions--the Protoss and the Zerg--don't get their day in the sun, so if you're a newcomer who wants to prove your superiority (or inferiority) online, don't expect the campaign to prepare you for the potential onslaught"
"But the campaign is hardly a one-note wonder, offering loads of variety, including an entire set of missions that divulges important story elements from an entirely different perspective"
"Yet even outside of those devious missions, you accomplish diverse and interesting tasks throughout the story"
"In one early mission, lava periodically rises onto the mainland, posing a threat to any units not positioned on high ground"
"In another, an exploding sun causes a deadly wall of flame to steadily push you across the map"
"From one mission to the next, there's an intriguing new development that keeps you devoted to seeing what surprise is waiting for you next.Many of these missions are RTS staples: Lead these small groups of units down this linear path, defend this specific structure, and so on"
"Yet Starcraft II gives these tasks meaningful context"
"Take the very first mission, for example"
"It's a very easy training mission, but one side objective has you take down holograms displaying emperor Arcturus Mengsk's political propaganda"
"After destroying these displays and arriving at your objective, the citizens rise up and join you, and you get a sense of the Terran dominion's heavy hand, as well as the peoples' desire to be freed from tyranny"
"A later mission puts you in control of an enormous mech and sends you off on a fiery rampage"
"Controlling a single unit in an RTS for any period of time isn't always fun, but because of how the mission is presented and its meaning within the story, this simple single-unit romp feels completely satisfying"
"Jim could use a shot of caffeine.Of course, the story plays out in more ways than simple mission objectives"
"You closely follow brooding freedom fighter Jim Raynor as he struggles to fight off the threat of the alien Zerg race, topple the manipulative Emperor Mengsk from his throne, and come to terms with his own guilt over the fate of Sarah Kerrigan"
"If you're headed into this sequel without any knowledge of prior events, you need not worry that you'll be in the dark: the campaign does an excellent job of filling in backstory even as the current narrative unfolds"
"The plot is uncomplicated, and the dialogue is action-movie simple, but Starcraft II's excellent cinematics, evocative soundtrack, and top-notch voice acting have a way of keeping you glued to the screen"
"Hero Jim Raynor is a strong but troubled man"
"You hear it in his resolute drawl, and the way the soundtrack signals his presence with its telltale twangs; you see it in the dark, moody way he's so often lit"
"The game punctuates its most poignant and thrilling moments with fantastic prerendered cutscenes, but even the in-engine cutscenes pull you in, thanks to expressive facial animations and plenty of humorous winks and nods scattered about.You do more than just watch cutscenes in between missions, however"
"This downtime is your chance to get to know the crew of Raynor's battlecruiser, the Hyperion"
"In a style similar to that of an adventure game, when you click on various characters and items on the screen, you might be rewarded with a short cutscene, a clever quip from a nerdy scientist, or a broadcast from a not-so-fair-and-balanced news agency"
"But these interludes aren't just for clicking and watching: You also upgrade and enhance your units and structures in important ways"
"By spending research points you earn on particular missions, you will gain access to permanent upgrades and new units normally associated with the Zerg and Protoss factions"
"However, these are either/or propositions: choosing one research option will lock you out of the other choice offered"
"You also earn currency to spend on other permanent upgrades or on mercenary units you can immediately summon to the battlefield"
"By their very nature, these options give the campaign replay value--value that's further elevated by a few occasions on which you must make a choice during the campaign that determines the course of minor story elements"
"These decisions don't just bring narrative consequences, however; they also determine which of two or more potential missions you must complete and have further impact on what units you might have access to or the enemy units you will face"
"The Protoss mothership may look imposing, but it's hardly an automatic win.And so the campaign is certainly not an incomplete game, in spite of the focus on a single faction"
"The structure of the campaign provides a strong argument for playing the entire thing from the beginning all over again or, at least, from an early save game"
"Furthermore, the campaign is of a goodly length, lasting 15 hours or more depending on how quickly you blow through missions, how much time you spend tooling around on the Hyperion, and what difficulty level you choose"
"But there's also another factor that will keep you coming back: an entire metagame in which you earn in-game achievements for accomplishing very specific tasks"
"Of course, such achievements are nothing new; Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network, Steam, and even Blizzard's own World of Warcraft have made good use of abstract rewards to keep players dedicated"
"But these achievements are woven through every aspect of the game, from the campaign to the multiplayer, and in turn, these achievements are broadcast to your in-game friends on the all-important Battle.net online service that serves as Starcraft II's primary interface.This Battle.net interface has its drawbacks"
"In order to play the game at all, you must create a Battle.net account and associate it with your game key"
"To earn achievements--even those in the single-player modes--you must be signed in to your account, which means always remaining online"
"(Fortunately, you can play the campaign as a guest when not signed into your Battle.net account, though you won't earn any rewards that way.) And though you can indicate that you are unavailable and block other users, you cannot make yourself invisible to the players on your friends list if you aren't in a social mood"
"Starcraft II is an intrinsically social experience"
"When friends receive achievements, you get a notification, which might drive a bit of friendly competition"
"You unlock and select from various user icons, which identify you to your friends and to your multiplayer rivals"
"You select which achievements you want to show off to anyone viewing your profile"
"And if you aren't sure which of your friends might be playing, the game will search your Facebook friends list and automatically send an invite to anyone with a Battle.net account"
"The social integration, the achievement notifications, and the intuitive and smooth interface make Battle.net--usually--a positive way of interfacing with Starcraft II.Sometimes you should stay and fight"
"Other timesâ€¦ get the hell out!Comment on this videoWatch this video in High DefStarCraft II is a competitive game of the highest order, and as such, it offers a fully featured online experience that is as thrilling as it is grueling"
"It begins with choosing the faction that best suits your play style"
"Every race offers versatility within its own units, and any number of strategies could be key to your success"
"If you play as Protoss, you might become enamored with the ominous flying void rays, which destroy both ground and air units with a focused beam of energy"
"But an enemy with a ready counter (say, Terran marines) might take advantage of the void's need to charge up before it fires"
"The Zerg are well known for facilitating rush tactics, but if you face a zergling rush as a Terran, flame-spewing hellions may be your answer"
"There are great opportunities for satisfying micromanagement with each race, whether that means using the Protoss phoenix to lift ground units into the sky or transforming soaring Terran vikings into assault walkers"
"Each of the three factions possesses its own strengths and weaknesses, but there are so many different ways of approaching the battle that you need to stay flexible, scout the enemy, and respond accordingly.These units and strategies make Starcraft II very similar to its predecessor"
"You won't see the drastic changes seen in the most recent Dawn of War and Command & Conquer games; Starcraft II is a highly traditional RTS"
"But you shouldn't discount the tweaks, the minor changes, and the additions and subtractions that differentiate this sequel from what came before"
"The larvaelike Protoss reaver, for example, was jettisoned in favor of the looming colossus, a thin-legged walker that razes ground units with a buzzing beam"
"(A group of them climbing over a short cliff into your base is a terrifying sight.) The Terran thor is a mechanical mass of limbs and missile launchers that can take on both air and ground units"
"(Their unit responses also sound suspiciously like Arnold Schwarzenegger.) On the Zerg side, nydus worms allow quick underground travel, and unlike the original game's nydus canals, they can be placed anywhere in your line of sight"
"Starcraft II will surely see some unit tweaks in the coming months, but even at this stage, the factions seem remarkably balanced, and every unit has an appropriate reply"
"You might miss your favorite units from the original, but the new ones are every bit as fun to use"
"Void rays are appealing to use and awesome to watch in battle, but they aren't invulnerable.The amount of content available in online play (and in offline play in skirmish mode) is remarkable"
"There are dozens of maps that support up 12 players, and matches can be tailored in the usual ways--grouping players into different teams, setting the game speed, and so on"
"You might group up with friends and conspire to take down an all-AI team or try your hand at a desperate six-player free-for-all"
"However, to show off your strategizing prowess, you'll want to get into ranked league matches, which is as easy as playing a series of games to determine which league you'll be placed in and then inching your way to the top"
"If this sounds intimidating, don't worry; you can take part in up to 50 slow-paced preliminary matches to get yourself prepared for the big boys.If you need further practice, you can always take on the AI in a stand-alone skirmish, and numerous AI difficulty levels let you set your own pace"
"There are also a series of challenges designed to get you familiar with each faction's units, as well as the intricacies of hotkeys, rush defense, and other gameplay elements"
"These challenges are enjoyable, testing your knowledge of proper counters and giving you a chance to learn the ins and outs of units and structures you don't utilize in the campaign"
"Like every other mode, the learning curve of these challenges is smooth, rewarding novices with lower-level achievements while pushing experts to try for the top-tier rewards"
"You may lament the inability to further practice with friends over a local area network, but fortunately, the Battle.net interface functions smoothly, and players that cause extreme lag can be removed from matches"
"You'll want to return to some missions to earn the most challenging achievements.Starcraft II was clearly built to run on all manner of PCs"
"Its system requirements are relatively low, and even at the highest settings, noticeable aliasing and some simple geometry keep it from setting a new bar for technical wizardry"
"Yet, it sports a wonderful sci-fi look and is filled with little details that constantly catch your eye, from buzzards scouring the dusty land to tiny civilian robots flitting to and fro"
"The campaign features a lovely variety of different environments, from tree-lined roadways stretching through green meadows to the charred crust of once-populated worlds"
"Units move with absolute fluidity, making the simple act of issuing orders a pleasure"
"Equally great sound effects augment the pleasure"
"The clicks and gurgles of the Zerg are appropriately repulsive, while the hums and buzzes of Protoss structures and units are distinctive and satisfying.The most dedicated of the dedicated will further contribute to Starcraft II's longevity by using the included user creation tools to develop new maps, new modifications, and even entirely different kinds of games"
"One such game--a top-down shoot-'em-up--is already featured within the campaign to show off the possibilities these tools bring to the table"
"These tools aren't as simple to use as what you'd find in, say, Little Big Planet, but there are already a good number of custom maps and modes to download, and there are assuredly many, many more on their way"
"But even without a burgeoning supply of user-created content, Starcraft II would stand on its own as a true gem, providing strategy veterans with a tournament-focused online package while easing newcomers in with easier difficulty levels, offline challenges, and even a friendly introduction to competitive play"
"The campaign's focus on the Terrans and a few scattered inconveniences aren't great nuisances--not in an RTS as outstanding as this one"
"Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty is not just an old game with a pretty new face"
"It's a varied and full-featured jewel that will keep you stuck to your computer chair for weeks, months, and even years to come.This is Blizzardâ€™s most polished game to date.Forget StarCraftâ€™s reputation as a punishing, multiplayer click-fest played only by rocket-powered Korean pro-gamers"
"StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty includes a lengthy and compelling singleplayer campaign, alongside some of the best multiplayer and co-op functionality Iâ€™ve seen"
"It offers a kind of baffling but welcome nostalgia"
"It looks, sounds, plays and feels like a game you may have loved from over ten years ago â€“ the original StarCraft"
"When you sit down to play it for the first time, if youâ€™re a PC gamer of any experience at all, youâ€™ll immediately understand whatâ€™s going on, and what you need to do to succeed.Your buildings can still fly"
"Like this one isn't.Yet this is clearly new and modern"
"It has a slick and gorgeous front-end, beautifully textured backdrops, 7.1 surround sound and superbly integrated achievements, leagues and challenges"
"Office workers will discover that their savegames travel from home to their work PC and back again thanks to cloud saving"
"If friends are playing, you can hook up with them via Facebook"
"And yes, frustratingly, it continues the modern trend of requiring you to be online to play, even in singleplayer"
"Although if youâ€™re disconnected during a mission, youâ€™re not booted out â€“ you just lose the ability to earn achievements in the campaign.Raynor shinesLetâ€™s examine that campaign"
"You play Jim Raynor, veteran space marshall, part-time cowboy"
"He is world weary, drunk and grizzled"
"He has faced multiple threats to the galaxy, from human dictators and rebellious traitors, to the repellent Zerg â€“ squishy cartoon bugs that can infest a planet and tear it apart"
"And there are his old sparring partners and occasional allies the Protoss: mystical space-elves"
"In the original StarCraft, Raynor and the Protoss formed a loose alliance against the Zerg"
"Thatâ€™s all been forgotten"
"Now, the human dictators are being dicks, the Protoss are back on the scene, and the Zerg are advancing"
"Itâ€™s the perfect time to lead an army.And what an army"
"In the campaign you (mostly) lead the Terran forces â€“ heavy metal space warriors that start every battle with a cigar fixed firmly to their bottom lip.The Terran units at your command are brilliant"
"I love the Marauders: robot-suited men with rocket launchers for hands"
"And I adore the Siege Tanks, which drive into position before planting extended feet firmly into the ground and pounding away with an upturned artillery battery"
"I think the basic marines are hilarious, particularly when upgraded with a small shield and dosed with stim packs (they run faster, shoot quicker and die easier)"
"And Iâ€™ve got a complete soft spot for the Firebat: a singleplayer-only soldier with flamethrowers for fists.Terran units ooze expression"
"Itâ€™s not just in their barks and responses to being clicked on"
"Itâ€™s in their art and animation"
"They jog into battle, arms swinging, eager to please"
"They die in glorious balls of goo"
"When a tank takes one too many rounds, it doesnâ€™t just fall apart, it explodes"
"StarCraft II is intensely readable â€“ the results of every artillery shell and Void Ray beam instantly apparent.Supply Depots are great for blocking land assaults.The tech each side brings to the party might be advanced, but in singleplayer you expect its application to be unsophisticated"
"For years now, RTS campaigns have repeated the same simple formula: secure a base, ramp up production by harvesting local resources, hold the fort until youâ€™ve got a walking ball of death, and then burst through any defences"
"Real-time strategy games have been killing the genre with this lack of imagination.StarCraft II shows us how itâ€™s meant to be done.The singleplayer campaign is superb"
"27 missions, each lasting 30-45 minutes, each containing a unique twist or idea that raises it above a simple base push"
"Early on, youâ€™re asked to defend a colony from infestation: hundreds of Zerg-infected humans and marines will shamble towards your gates at night"
"Holding out means building bunkers and filling them with Firebats and Marines, and praying they hold"
"The same zergbie humans are burnt to a crisp when the sun rises the next morning: thatâ€™s your cue to push out with Hellions â€“ buggies with roof-mounted flamethrowers â€“ to torch the remnants of the infested colony.Manufacturers of fine explosions since 1853As the sun sets and rises every five minutes, thereâ€™s a gorgeous transition, each little soldier casting a long purple shadow"
"And when the sun bursts through, the poor zombie souls flail and wave as they roast alive"
"You can see the effort and thought that has gone into every little model, every tiny animation.The zombie mission might be a standout, but itâ€™s not alone"
"Iâ€™ve enjoyed nearly every mission, including a raid on a prison planet that played out like a beginnerâ€™s version of Defence of the Ancients: you control a single overpowered hero while waves of basic marines throw themselves at the defences"
"And then there was the race for resources where I was fighting over mineral patches and scrap metal to buy off a vast mercenary army"
"When you can finally afford the bribe, their unstoppable regiments are turned over to your control"
"Or thereâ€™s a last-ditch defence of a planet marked for extermination, where a Protoss mothership can only be shot down once youâ€™ve defeated three powerful bases"
"All the while, the mothership is vapourising infected colonists.None of these objectives can be completed by simply selecting everyone and sending them forward, nor would that solution be fun"
"The fun in singleplayer RTS is in figuring out the right combination of soldiers to send forward, and how best to neuter the opposition"
"StarCraft II delivers the most entertaining options, and the most entertaining solutions"
"You canâ€™t just select ten siege tanks and send them toward a Zerg base â€“ they might outrange the Spine Crawler defences (horrific fleshy spikes), but theyâ€™ll get chewed up by fliers, such as Mutalisks, and any zerglings that can reach close range"
"Youâ€™ll want a mixed force of vehicles and infantry, tailored to the situation"
"Maybe a group of Vikings to take out any fliers, supporting Marauders"
"When the fliers are down, the Vikings will sprout legs and turn into heavy armoured walkers.And anyway, you might not have access to the optimal unit mix at the time"
"You might have to improvise.Plot doctorSurprisingly, StarCraft IIâ€™s campaign allows for a certain degree of choice"
"Once youâ€™re past the introductory storyline, in which Raynor gathers his forces, youâ€™re usually allowed to choose between two or three different missions to progress"
"Each ties into a different characterâ€™s storyline"
"Thereâ€™s Tychus Findlay, an absurdly muscled marine recently released from prison â€“ heâ€™s being paid to find alien artifacts that may or may not relate to a terrible prophecy"
"Thereâ€™s Ariel Hanson, a gorgeous (admit it â€“ you would) scientist searching for a cure to the Zerg infection, while trying to save refugee colonists"
"And thereâ€™s Gabriel Tosh, a mercenary-cum-voodoo warrior with a dark secret"
"He likes dolls"
"The writing might not be that sharp, nor the characterisation more than ludicrous butch clichÃ©, but itâ€™s passable.One consequence of picking and choosing missions is that you may enter scenarios without certain key technology, and have to improvise less than ideal solutions"
"Which, it turns out, is all kinds of fun.Most of StarCraft IIâ€™s stories end with a choice of finales"
"Do you release prisoners from New Folsom, or shut down the secret programme theyâ€™re recruited for"
"Do you allow Protoss to purge a homeworld, or save the colonists from certain death, even though they may be infected"
"The level structure allows you at least minimal choice, and therefore to engage better with the overarching storyline"
"And even though StarCraft II is going to get two expansions, few will feel shortchanged by the ending here, or the sheer number of missions.How stories play out, and the rewards for completing missions, are brought to life by StarCraft IIâ€™s gloriously over-the-top front-end, which harks back to the beautiful between-mission interfaces of such ancient PC games as Descent: Freespace and X-Wing"
"As Raynor, aboard his flagship Hyperion, you donâ€™t select missions, or research unit upgrades, or hire mercenaries from simple menus â€“ you go to a laboratory, or the bridge, or the cantina, and select them by using consoles or computers"
"Itâ€™s frippery of the best kind: pure atmosphere"
"Iâ€™m an absolute sucker for this sort of silliness â€“ I could spend hours just clicking on the TV in the bar and watching fake news broadcasts.At the end of this relatively straightforward mission, you fight giant evil statues.R&DI was also pleasantly surprised at the choice available when customising my army"
"At its most basic, you can purchase upgrades for your favourite units and buildings"
"Timed charges for your Reapers (shock troopers that can jetpack into the back of a base), or a permanent cloak for your Ghosts (elite infantry that can call down nukes)"
"Thereâ€™s also research: each mission offers sub-objectives and collectible items: relics and Zerg DNA "
"Two separate tech trees, one for Zerg, one for Protoss, offer parallel development routes"
"At five point intervals, youâ€™re asked to make a permanent choice to upgrade your army"
"At one branch of the Zerg tree, you can pick a heavy transport, or robot dogs"
"You can increase your bunker resilience, or bolt a mounted gun to the roof"
"And there are mercenaries to hire: elite troops that can be dropped into the battlefield.Making the choices, spending your scarce cash, is hard"
"Every option seems useful, and trying to chose between them will lead to a furrowed brow.What the campaign fails to do is deliver scenarios in which youâ€™re free to use the complete range of units and abilities against competent AI opponents"
"Thatâ€™s where the skirmish mode comes in"
"The AI is ferocious: occasionally rushing, sometimes holding back with a mixed army"
"On medium, most players will find it a challenge"
"Youâ€™re also free to create mixed matches of human and AI players, or pitch AI s against each other"
"The results are fascinating, and a near perfect training ground for online"
"Which is where the other fun begins.MultiplayerI think many new players are nervous about venturing online â€“ particularly given the reputation of pro-players"
"In practice, the new Battle.net delivers excellent matchmaking and leagues, for teams of up to four"
"The sides feel relatively evenly matched, and any cheesy rushes have easy-to-remember counters"
"There are far more Terran players online in the lower leagues, presumably thanks to the campaign serving as an extended training level, but theyâ€™re certainly not dominating.Banshees can cloak, rendering large primitive forces useless.Millions of words will be expended on whether certain units or combinations and counters are unbalanced"
"They can be summed up in one sentence: StarCraft II is more than ready for competitive gaming"
"What imbalances there were have been addressed in a long, long beta period.The best way of describing the joy of StarCraft II online is this: even if you win, you are usually left exhausted"
"The mental effort required to scout your opponent, match their economy, deliver a counter and execute a plan will leave you drained and broken"
"If you lose, the mental effort is the same, sometimes greater"
"But you never leave unhappy"
"You simply want to learn where you went wrong, how you can improve and what to change next time"
"If I win, I want to jump back in and prove myself again"
"If I lose, I want to try again, maybe a different build order, maybe scout earlier.New or nervous players have plenty of opportunity to learn in the Practice League"
"These early matches are played on modified maps (most block off the entrance to your base, to prevent an early rush), and donâ€™t contribute to your overall ranking"
"But when the bug finally gets to you, you can skip them and head right to your placement matches"
"There, youâ€™re dropped into regional leagues and matched with players of broadly similar skill.Yes, StarCraft is fiercely competitive"
"But the community is largely friendly and receptive"
"Most matches online are preceded by a â€˜glhfâ€™, and the losers â€“ even AI players â€“ will sign off with a â€˜ggâ€™.And thatâ€™s the point"
"It is a good game"
"Itâ€™s a great game"
"Playing it, repelling wave upon wave of Zerg forces in the singleplayer levels, bullying your way into the league rankings in the relentless multiplayer leagues, or just hanging about in the luxurious campaign front-end, is to be reminded that PC gaming has always been the most vital, and most exciting platform on the planet"
"More please.A gloriously well crafted campaign welded to a near Olympic competitive experience"
"StarCraft II is practically essential"

Many of these achievements are only pointed out after the mission ends, which might have some people hitting the replay button right away, but usually you can guess what the achievement might be from the in-game communications.But even if the achievements donâ€™t appeal to you, the game is still difficult to put a time frame to because there are so many ways to play, and while they might be radically different, there is no wrong way

But these are nitpicks, forgivable quibbles in a high-quality game that provides plenty of bang for the buck
Attention to detail throughout the rest of the game, like the sparring of the spider mines in Raynor's armory and general level of wear and tear in other environments (the spider web above the Cantina's television and boots hanging from the overhead wires) shows that a lot of thought was put into delivering believable environments
