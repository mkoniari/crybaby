	Is Blizzard's latest also its greatest?, In StarCraft II, it's still the Terrans, Zerg, and Protoss clashing against each other, and you're still mining minerals with SCVs, Drones, and Probes and pulling Vespene Gas from the ground to fuel production., It's a classic style of real-time strategy play, one old-school RTS gamers should be very familiar with., Compared to the changes Blizzard made between the traditional gameplay of Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness and the hero-based leveling elements of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, StarCraft II feels like a relatively safe play; a game designed to slide in and discreetly supplant its predecessor instead of ruffle the feathers of longtime StarCraft devotees and risk rejection., While it's not a revolutionary game, it is one of the most fully featured, expertly designed, and impressively refined real-time strategy experiences on the market., Even though at its most basic level a lot of the game is familiar, much has been adjusted., In no area is this more apparent than in the single-player campaign., Blizzard's decision to split the overall story of StarCraft II into three parts sparked some controversy when it was first announced; basically that means you only get to play as the Terran faction (with a few exceptions) for the solo portion, and must wait until later for the Zerg and Protoss campaigns to be released to see the entirety of the story., While that affects some of the impact of the tale, it in no way means you'll be starved for content if all you're looking to do in StarCraft II is play alone., There's a huge campaign here that could easily take many hours to play through (depending on your style and level of difficulty)., It's all exceedingly well presented, with a totally reworked narrative delivery system, a few instances of choice driving the story, and options for inter-mission upgrades that make it feel like more of an role-playing experience than a series of mission that exist solely to get you ready for the multiplayer., Video Review

Unlike the original game, this time around you won't be staring at the sparsely animated heads of major characters as they bicker and plot on video monitors between missions., Instead, Blizzard gives you a detailed world to play around in to give its fictional universe a greater sense of place and atmosphere., The action follows along with Jim Raynor, who begins the game as a gruff alcoholic in the process of rebelling against Arcturus Mengsk, the corrupt emperor of the Terran Dominion., If you've forgotten the StarCraft storyline or never got around to learning it, then it should be fairly easy to dig into this one, though you're going to miss a lot of references., Regardless of your level of exposure to the fiction, it's difficult to ignore the eye-rolling cliches and talk of prophecies being fulfilled, and the overabundance of 1980s action movie-style macho posturing and cheesiness., It's all snugly wrapped around the missions though, which makes it easier to look beyond the standard sci-fi trappings and appreciate the detail that's gone into the creation of the character models, the smoothness of the animations, and the amount of character interaction packed into the experience., Since missions are bookended by cut-scenes, great voice acting, and rewards, it makes each feel important in its own way, and adds to your motivation to meet every challenge., It's something a lot of developers besides Blizzard have difficulty doing in this genre, with their missions often feeling like a string of meaningless, boring tasks., Additional narrative is also provided through interactive environments between missions., You're able to explore various settings, from a dusty building at the campaign's outset to Raynor's starship, the Hyperion, and beyond as the action continues., Eventually the entirety of the game's options and locations are unlocked, letting you flip around to different areas of the ship to talk to major characters or purchase upgrades., On top of that, new units are unlocked depending on which mission you choose to take on next, which can be further modified in the upgrade center, adding significant bonuses to each like more effective healing for medics or boosted protection for Marines., Because the campaign isn't tied down by the strict rules of multiplayer balance, this also means you'll see a number of favorites return from the original., Firebats, Vultures, Goliaths and more can be unlocked and upgraded in the story mode, which is both a great nod to fans and adds more variety for new players., It's a system that's constantly giving you new things to play around with and ways to modify what's already available, making progressions more exciting., StarCraft in 5 Minutes

As if  that wasn't enough, even more options for army customization exist throughout the campaign, including a research system and mercenary units., These mercs can be hired by Raynor for a fee, and when deployed in battle serve as elite versions of existing units that are called in instantly., It can be great in a bind, and adds to the stable of available fighters when setting up a battle plan., Optional objectives in missions call for the collection of Protoss or Zerg research items, which can then be turned in between stages for even more upgrades., Along both Zerg and Protoss paths these upgrades exist in pairs - where selecting one locks out the other - meaning you'll have to make permanent decisions about things like whether you want to buff the armor of a Bunker or slap a gun turret on top., All these modification systems combined make for a highly customizable campaign experience that's consistently fun because it introduces a steady stream of new content and options, making sure there's always something to look forward to trying out for the first time., Customization is a big part of the campaign's appeal, but really the best part is the mission design., It's quite a feat for Blizzard to stuff in this many missions and give each a unique feel, but that's exactly what's been done., Each can be broken down into basic and familiar escort, commando, defense, and assault types of tasks, but within each of these a special element is always thrown in., Sometimes it's a giant wave of fire slowly sweeping across a map spurring you to frequently relocate your base in pursuit of objectives., Sometimes it's a see-saw back and forth battle between armies as you vie to capture nodes located around map., Sometimes you'll just be in control of a single unit and need to stealth into enemy territory, relying on AI controlled allies to help wipe out detectors so you can snipe, slice and nuke your enemies into submission., I'd recommend any seasoned RTS player bump the difficulty to Hard since Normal is pretty easy, but regardless of skill level the game is always fun because the mission objectives are so diverse., Over the coming weeks we will be looking at World of Warcraf..., Mass Effect 2 (PC)

Brace yourselves, the story has had 12 years to spawn expansion packs, novels and the fertile ground of gamers? imagination where it has grown to epic proportions.In the 25th century, humanity will be known as the Terrans, and we will still be kicking the crap out of each other, just on a galactic scale.? On a backwater planet, a marshal named Jim Raynor steps into the role as an unlikely leader, and fights off a horrifying attack from an insect-like swarm race known as the Zerg that are the stuff of nightmares.Unfortunately the Zerg aren?t the only problem for Raynor and the Terrans, as the oppressive Confederacy of Man moves in and unjustly arrests Raynor.? Raynor then joins the growing revolution against the Confederation, where he meets Arcturus Mengsk.? The two join forces and soon Raynor falls for Mengsk?s second-in command, Sarah Kerrigan.In what was a fairly major twist, Mengsk betrays everyone and shows his true colors as a tyrant., It is revealed that Mengsk was using the Zerg, and luring them to inhabited worlds to further his own goals by attacking his enemies.? Through his betrayals, Kerrigan is left to die, but is instead captured and mutated by the Zerg.? Raynor, believing her dead, forms his own resistance group called ?Raynor?s Raiders?, and the war grows., Kerrigan returns as the Queen of Blades, betrays everyone, and helps push civilization to the brink of destruction., The Protoss, the most technologically advanced race in known galaxy join the fight against the Zerg, and total war engulfs the galaxy.As the flames of war begin to burn everywhere, Raynor and a Protoss commander named Tassadar, discover the key to defeating the Zerg was to destroy the Overmind.? Raynor joins a desperate final assault on the Overmind, and Tassadar gives his life to destroy the Overmind.? It was fairly epic stuff.The sequel picks up four years later, and again follows Raynor, as he continues to fight Mengsk and the Terran Dominion., Soon, the Zerg begin an all out attack, led by the Queen of Blades, who is seeking several mysterious relics., To give away more would do a disservice to fans who have been waiting for the campaign, but suffice to say they should be happy with the depth of both the characters and the storyline.CampaignThe campaign follows the Terrans though a series of branching storylines that allow you to choose which order you want to play through, as well as giving you the occasional choice that will force you to side with one group or another., Despite the options, the game still follows a ?mostly linear story, but it is engrossing enough that most will be happy to watch the scripted plot unfold.Once you have taken control, the game plays out like many real-time strategy games, but it does so with a polish and finesse., Rather than reinventing the genre, Blizzard wisely takes what works, tightens it up, and streamlines the rest., The result is a gameplay style that will immediately feel familiar to fans of the genre, and yet still feel fresh and new as well., Players who aren?t familiar with the genre will still have some troubles at first, but should be able to stumble their way through until they get the hang of things., ?RTS games are inherently difficult to master, but StarCraft II manages to balance complex, but intuitive controls against an ever increasing level of difficulty that eases you into using the full control scheme., It is a fine balancing act, but one that works.After playing a few maps, you will quickly see the level of thought that went into the gameplay., Frequently in RTS games, gamers will find something- usually just a minor thing or two- that they wish they could do but can?t., Sometimes it is just a simple matter of wishing they could see where a certain unit is, or that there were simpler ways to do a particular chain of commands., It is inevitable with the genre, and usually more to do with the gamer?s individual style than anything., In StarCraft II, you will frequently start to ?wish Blizzard had done this or that, then see that there is a way to do exactly what you hoped for., Some games spend years on exacting and detailed graphics., Blizzard spent years on exacting and detailed controls., With games like these, you can?t please everyone- there are so many personal preferences to deal with- but no matter what, you cannot fault Blizzard for the time and thought they put into the controls.As for the campaign itself, the story is deep and compelling, but it is difficult to put an exact number on how many hours it will take to complete., Unlike other, more linear games, StarCraft II could be as long or as short as you want it to be., The campaign missions each feature multiple achievements that require you to go above and beyond just completing the mission requirements., Many of these achievements are only pointed out after the mission ends, which might have some people hitting the replay button right away, but usually you can guess what the achievement might be from the in-game communications.But even if the achievements don?t appeal to you, the game is still difficult to put a time frame to because there are so many ways to play, and while they might be radically different, there is no wrong way., Some players might be offensively-minded and want to rush out and take the fight to the enemy, while others might set up defenses and let the enemy come to them., It can be the difference between a 20-minute game and an hour long game, and neither is wrong., A balanced player might be able to beat the campaign in 20 hours or so, while an achievement driven player could easily double that time.The missions themselves are interesting and varied, and each new setting offers something different., Some levels will have you simply clear an area or defend a base- standard RTS stuff- while others will give you time based events that require you to react to the situation, which then changes and forces you to adapt., One early level has you under attack by the Zerg at night which forces you into a defensive posture until the sun rises, which then puts you on the offensive as you hunt the Zerg bases until the sun sets again., ?Another level has you gathering materials in a lava bed, then quickly retreating and waiting as lava flows in, then back out and the countdown begins again.In general RTS games can rarely illicit emotion from players., ?They are a thinking person?s game, and as such you focus more on the next several moves than the mission itself- unless of course you?count?frustration as an emotion-??but seldom do you play a strategy game that has you nervous and wondering how you can possibly survive., Several of the missions in StarCraft II do just that, and you will find yourself keenly aware of everything happening on the board as you fight to survive and alter your tactics on the fly., It is an impressive feat for a game in the genre.MultiplayerBut as good as the campaign may be, a few weeks from now, no one will care about the single player side ? the focus will all be on the online multiplayer., When the StarCraft II beta came out, it was hard to get a real impression of the online side of the game., It was a beta, after all, and the point was to check the technical side of the game more than the gameplay or ?fun factor?., After playing the beta and seeing the difference in the final game, it seems obvious that Blizzard knew exactly what they were doing.The multiplayer aspect of the game is an incredibly well honed experience, and one of the best online games ever made., While the campaign might look great, and the cinematics are what you will see in the ads, it is really the multiplayer that will make this game a worthy successor, or a disastrous failure., In truth, only time will tell if players fully accept StarCraft II., The original became something of a phenomenon that took on a life of its own, but Blizzard has made sure to do their part and offer the tools to make this game the new ?go to? game for RTS fans.The first thing people will notice is that despite the inherent strengths and weaknesses of each of the three playable races, they are all well balanced, and there is no one particular strategy that will dominate the others., Each race plays differently., The Terrans are a balanced group, the Zerg are an overwhelming swarm, and the Protoss are the most technologically advanced., But no matter who you play as, you will find a strategy that works, and a counter strategy to that., If you aren?t familiar with the RTS genre, you might overlook the detail in the multiplayer, but after you play a few games and begin to see the way the matches can turn into battles of ebb and flow, you will realize that Blizzard spent a LOT of time fine tuning the multiplayer aspect of the game., There will be a steep learning curve for players unfamiliar with the genre, but most will quickly learn and adapt.GraphicsAs for the graphics, they are what you would expect, but maybe not what you would hope for., They are solid and look great, but after waiting 12 years it is hard not to be a bit disappointed that the game won?t blow you away graphically., Maybe that is unfair to the game, but it has been 12 years., That isn?t to say that the game doesn?t look great- it does., The detail is intricate, the character models look good, and the maps and locations are engrossing., We were using a Maingear eX-L 17 computer for the review, which might be a bit of an overkill, but most systems shouldn?t have much trouble running the game near its peak output.The sound is also top notch, and little things like the jukebox in the cantina will frequently play songs that are original to the game, including one that talks about shooting Zerg., It is details like that which will make you smile, but you?ll quickly forget about them and move on., StarCraft II?s toughest competition is likely to be the expectations it faces., If you come in without any hype, you will likely be impressed.No More LAN Parties?Despite how good the game is, there are two noticeable problems with StarCraft II, and while both are understandable, it is hard to be enthusiastic about either., The first is a totally understandable, but somewhat regrettable exclusion of LAN play., For many this will not be an issue at all, but for some that have fond memories of LAN parties, this might come as a blow., There is no reason you could not recreate the LAN party online, but it just isn?t the same, and it leaves you at the mercy of the battle.net servers that you need to sign into each time to play., While reviewing this game, lag and problems with battle.net were frequent, but hopefully that is just growing pains for the game as the servers gradually begin to accept the strain of the huge influx of launch day purchasers.The reason that LAN parties are not included is actually somewhat clever and understandable., It is also the reason you didn?t see any reviews of the game on the launch day., When you play StarCraft II, you are required to authenticate your copy of the game on the battle.net servers in order to verify that you are not pirating the game (the servers did not go active until launch day, which prohibited early reviews)., Given time, someone may find a way around this with a crack, but with software piracy a massive concern for PC games, Blizzard might be on to something here., It is a shame that LAN parties had to be a casualty of the anti-piracy measures, but it is understandable.Too Many Expansion Packs on the Horizon?The second problem is more of a business one than something that will affect the game., While the campaign is deep and rewarding, it is also just one-third of the story., In the campaign you are only allowed to play as the Terrans., Blizzard has promised that the Zerg and the Protoss campaigns are coming soon, but both will require purchase., Again, an understandable business decision, and one that shouldn?t count too harshly against the game, but it still leaves a bit of a bad taste in your mouth., It is hard not to see it as a money grab, even if there are legitimate reasons to withhold the campaigns, and even if it is a reasonable business strategy., Still kinda sucks.Despite these minor flaws, StarCraft II is a deep and intuitive game that will please veterans of the series, and allow new players to see what all the hype is about., Whether or not it becomes the classic that the predecessor did remains to be seen, but Blizzard has done their job and released a worthy successor, as well what is probably best RTS game made yet., Related PostsStarCraft II Sells 1.5 Million Copies in?Starcraft 2 Collector?s Edition to be Pr?World of Warcraft: Cataclysm sets first?World of Warcraft: Cataclysm launches

policy, click here., When posting a comment, you agree to our Terms of Service., It doesn't stray far from the blueprint created by its predecessors, but it is, without a doubt, the best game to ever adhere to that formula., Passing judgment on the most eagerly anticipated game of the last few years is no easy task; it's difficult to set aside prejudices that would sway one's opinion either way., Let's face it: Starcraft comes with a great deal of anticipatory baggage, and it would be easy to say that it's either a huge disappointment or the greatest thing since real-time strategy became a household phrase., Truth is, it's neither., Weighed on its own merits, Starcraft is an extremely well-crafted game, albeit one with a few notable problems., It doesn't stray far from the blueprint created by its predecessors (namely the Warcrafts and Command & Conquers), but it is, without a doubt, the best game to ever adhere to that formula., Starcraft offers a lengthy single-player campaign featuring ten missions for its three diverse races, totaling 30 single-player missions in all (there's also an unsupported veteran campaign included as part of the campaign editor)., The story is compelling enough to make playing through all three worthwhile, and the campaign difficulty is tiered so that each is more challenging than the last., While this may seem like an uninteresting point, it helps Starcraft to avoid the problem that has plagued every other game in the genre: Each side is not the same., You don't have to go through a set of training missions once you've already mastered one side., The missions themselves mainly stick to the "gather, build, and conquer" philosophy, but there are a few innovative missions thrown in, and Blizzard has added some narrative elements to the missions themselves that help to keep things interesting., With the exception of the installation missions (in which you are given a handful of units to raid an enemy base, an attempt to break from the mold that is only occasionally successful), the missions are well designed., The solo player also has the option of skirmish missions, though the computer opponents have the annoying ability to see everything you are doing and defend accordingly, making the dreaded "rush" tactic one of the only viable means of emerging victorious., Starcraft offers an equally nice suite of options on the multiplayer side: There's head-to-head and up to eight-player battles over LAN or Internet (though Internet play is only available over Blizzard's Battle.net server, which includes a ranking list and seems to be as lag-free as it gets nowadays)., There is a good variety of multiplayer game types, and you can easily download new maps., Multiplayer has its own set of negatives, the major one being the predominance of rushing., Like it or not, creating a horde of the most basic units and attacking the enemy immediately is an effective tactic., Only a heavily defended base will survive an early rush of Terran Marines or Protoss Zealots., Starcraft has a built-in safeguard to discourage rushing, but it's one of the game's most problematic areas., This safeguard is in the interface, which only allows you to select 12 units at a time., This isn't especially effective, considering six Zealots will smoke a base early in the game., The selectable unit cap does make rushing more difficult, but it also becomes frustrating at times, especially for those used to the ability to select unlimited units at once., Often, selecting the chosen units from a large group becomes a time-consuming effort., During battle, it can be an exercise in frustration., You can assign groups to hotkeys quite easily, however, lessening the frustration of the selectable unit cap - but this system isn't nearly as good as in Total Annihilation or Dark Reign, and units aren't marked by their group number like in said games., Multiplayer battles can often be decided by who has the best manual dexterity and can overcome the built-in limitations of the interface the most quickly., Recent real-time innovations regarding unit control are included, with mixed results., Each production facility can have up to five units queued at once., There's a waypoint system, patrolling, and the like - but many of these options aren't particularly well implemented, and some of the options seem tacked on., On the other hand, pathing is great, with only occasional glitches (where a unit will run around in cute little circles)., Starcraft most notably lacks the ability to define unit behavior (as in Dark Reign or Total Annihilation), leading to much micromanagement., What Starcraft does have, though, is personality., Playing any of the three races is a notably different experience., You have the Terrans, "space trailer trash" with moving buildings; the frightening, insect-like Zerg who can burrow underground; and the hi-tech Protoss who can easily construct many buildings at a time., Each race features totally different units, often with no equivalents on the other side, differing construction and repair principles, and even different (though equally effective) interface art., Blizzard has managed to keep it well balanced despite the great diversity., One of the greatest things about Starcraft is that no unit is ever rendered obsolete during the course of a game., Each unit is key in certain situations, and you'll still be relying on your most basic ground units in the endgame., Aesthetically, Starcraft is impressive., Graphically, it stands alongside Age of Empires as the best-looking 2D strategy game around., What it lacks in visual innovation it makes up for in style; the unit and building animations are highly detailed and imaginative., There are some nice translucency effects, such as the flickering shields on Protoss units., The tilesets and maps are varied and interesting, and the unit portraits are expressive and realistic., And the cinematics, of which there are many, are outstanding., The only real complaints about the visuals are that the viewing area is a little small (the bottom quarter of the screen is occupied by the interface), and the minimap presents only rudimentary information., The music, apart from some new-agey Terran tunes, is appropriately melodic and dark, the sound effects are believable and distinct, and the voice acting is great, bringing the characters to life., Starcraft's personality goes a long way towards rendering its minor shortcomings obsolete., The game has so much life in it - whether in the great, narrative-driven single-player campaign or the multitude of multiplayer options - you won't grow tired of it anytime soon., And even if you blow through it all, there's an incredibly versatile editor that allows you to create your own full-featured campaigns, right down to spoken introductions and triggered events within missions., It all comes down to this: Starcraft may not do anything particularly new, but it does the real-time thing as well or better than any game before it., If you're willing to give the formula another go, Starcraft is highly recommended., By Ron Dulin,

 3 Units of Protoss revealed., StarCraft 2 review, This is Blizzard?s most polished game to date., Forget StarCraft?s reputation as a punishing, multiplayer click-fest played only by rocket-powered Korean pro-gamers., StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty includes a lengthy and compelling singleplayer campaign, alongside some of the best multiplayer and co-op functionality I?ve seen., It offers a kind of baffling but welcome nostalgia., It looks, sounds, plays and feels like a game you may have loved from over ten years ago ? the original StarCraft., When you sit down to play it for the first time, if you?re a PC gamer of any experience at all, you?ll immediately understand what?s going on, and what you need to do to succeed., Your buildings can still fly., Like this one isn't., Yet this is clearly new and modern., It has a slick and gorgeous front-end, beautifully textured backdrops, 7.1 surround sound and superbly integrated achievements, leagues and challenges., Office workers will discover that their savegames travel from home to their work PC and back again thanks to cloud saving., If friends are playing, you can hook up with them via Facebook., And yes, frustratingly, it continues the modern trend of requiring you to be online to play, even in singleplayer., Although if you?re disconnected during a mission, you?re not booted out ? you just lose the ability to earn achievements in the campaign., Raynor shines
Let?s examine that campaign., You play Jim Raynor, veteran space marshall, part-time cowboy., He has faced multiple threats to the galaxy, from human dictators and rebellious traitors, to the repellent Zerg ? squishy cartoon bugs that can infest a planet and tear it apart., And there are his old sparring partners and occasional allies the Protoss: mystical space-elves., In the original StarCraft, Raynor and the Protoss formed a loose alliance against the Zerg., That?s all been forgotten., Now, the human dictators are being dicks, the Protoss are back on the scene, and the Zerg are advancing., It?s the perfect time to lead an army., In the campaign you (mostly) lead the Terran forces ? heavy metal space warriors that start every battle with a cigar fixed firmly to their bottom lip., The Terran units at your command are brilliant., I love the Marauders: robot-suited men with rocket launchers for hands., And I adore the Siege Tanks, which drive into position before planting extended feet firmly into the ground and pounding away with an upturned artillery battery., I think the basic marines are hilarious, particularly when upgraded with a small shield and dosed with stim packs (they run faster, shoot quicker and die easier)., And I?ve got a complete soft spot for the Firebat: a singleplayer-only soldier with flamethrowers for fists., Terran units ooze expression., It?s not just in their barks and responses to being clicked on., It?s in their art and animation., They jog into battle, arms swinging, eager to please., When a tank takes one too many rounds, it doesn?t just fall apart, it explodes., StarCraft II is intensely readable ? the results of every artillery shell and Void Ray beam instantly apparent., Supply Depots are great for blocking land assaults., The tech each side brings to the party might be advanced, but in singleplayer you expect its application to be unsophisticated., For years now, RTS campaigns have repeated the same simple formula: secure a base, ramp up production by harvesting local resources, hold the fort until you?ve got a walking ball of death, and then burst through any defences., Real-time strategy games have been killing the genre with this lack of imagination., StarCraft II shows us how it?s meant to be done., 27 missions, each lasting 30-45 minutes, each containing a unique twist or idea that raises it above a simple base push., Early on, you?re asked to defend a colony from infestation: hundreds of Zerg-infected humans and marines will shamble towards your gates at night., Holding out means building bunkers and filling them with Firebats and Marines, and praying they hold., The same zergbie humans are burnt to a crisp when the sun rises the next morning: that?s your cue to push out with Hellions ? buggies with roof-mounted flamethrowers ? to torch the remnants of the infested colony., Manufacturers of fine explosions since 1853
As the sun sets and rises every five minutes, there?s a gorgeous transition, each little soldier casting a long purple shadow., And when the sun bursts through, the poor zombie souls flail and wave as they roast alive., You can see the effort and thought that has gone into every little model, every tiny animation., The zombie mission might be a standout, but it?s not alone., I?ve enjoyed nearly every mission, including a raid on a prison planet that played out like a beginner?s version of Defence of the Ancients: you control a single overpowered hero while waves of basic marines throw themselves at the defences., And then there was the race for resources where I was fighting over mineral patches and scrap metal to buy off a vast mercenary army., When you can finally afford the bribe, their unstoppable regiments are turned over to your control., Or there?s a last-ditch defence of a planet marked for extermination, where a Protoss mothership can only be shot down once you?ve defeated three powerful bases., All the while, the mothership is vapourising infected colonists., None of these objectives can be completed by simply selecting everyone and sending them forward, nor would that solution be fun., The fun in singleplayer RTS is in figuring out the right combination of soldiers to send forward, and how best to neuter the opposition., StarCraft II delivers the most entertaining options, and the most entertaining solutions., You can?t just select ten siege tanks and send them toward a Zerg base ? they might outrange the Spine Crawler defences (horrific fleshy spikes), but they?ll get chewed up by fliers, such as Mutalisks, and any zerglings that can reach close range., You?ll want a mixed force of vehicles and infantry, tailored to the situation., Maybe a group of Vikings to take out any fliers, supporting Marauders., When the fliers are down, the Vikings will sprout legs and turn into heavy armoured walkers., And anyway, you might not have access to the optimal unit mix at the time., You might have to improvise., Plot doctor
Surprisingly, StarCraft II?s campaign allows for a certain degree of choice., Once you?re past the introductory storyline, in which Raynor gathers his forces, you?re usually allowed to choose between two or three different missions to progress., Each ties into a different character?s storyline., There?s Tychus Findlay, an absurdly muscled marine recently released from prison ? he?s being paid to find alien artifacts that may or may not relate to a terrible prophecy., There?s Ariel Hanson, a gorgeous (admit it ? you would) scientist searching for a cure to the Zerg infection, while trying to save refugee colonists., And there?s Gabriel Tosh, a mercenary-cum-voodoo warrior with a dark secret., The writing might not be that sharp, nor the characterisation more than ludicrous butch clich?, but it?s passable., One consequence of picking and choosing missions is that you may enter scenarios without certain key technology, and have to improvise less than ideal solutions., Which, it turns out, is all kinds of fun., Most of StarCraft II?s stories end with a choice of finales., Do you release prisoners from New Folsom, or shut down the secret programme they?re recruited for?, Do you allow Protoss to purge a homeworld, or save the colonists from certain death, even though they may be infected?, The level structure allows you at least minimal choice, and therefore to engage better with the overarching storyline., And even though StarCraft II is going to get two expansions, few will feel shortchanged by the ending here, or the sheer number of missions., How stories play out, and the rewards for completing missions, are brought to life by StarCraft II?s gloriously over-the-top front-end, which harks back to the beautiful between-mission interfaces of such ancient PC games as Descent: Freespace and X-Wing., As Raynor, aboard his flagship Hyperion, you don?t select missions, or research unit upgrades, or hire mercenaries from simple menus ? you go to a laboratory, or the bridge, or the cantina, and select them by using consoles or computers., It?s frippery of the best kind: pure atmosphere., I?m an absolute sucker for this sort of silliness ? I could spend hours just clicking on the TV in the bar and watching fake news broadcasts., At the end of this relatively straightforward mission, you fight giant evil statues., R&D
I was also pleasantly surprised at the choice available when customising my army., At its most basic, you can purchase upgrades for your favourite units and buildings., Timed charges for your Reapers (shock troopers that can jetpack into the back of a base), or a permanent cloak for your Ghosts (elite infantry that can call down nukes)., There?s also research: each mission offers sub-objectives and collectible items: relics and Zerg DNA ., Two separate tech trees, one for Zerg, one for Protoss, offer parallel development routes., At five point intervals, you?re asked to make a permanent choice to upgrade your army., At one branch of the Zerg tree, you can pick a heavy transport, or robot dogs., You can increase your bunker resilience, or bolt a mounted gun to the roof., And there are mercenaries to hire: elite troops that can be dropped into the battlefield., Making the choices, spending your scarce cash, is hard., Every option seems useful, and trying to chose between them will lead to a furrowed brow., What the campaign fails to do is deliver scenarios in which you?re free to use the complete range of units and abilities against competent AI opponents., That?s where the skirmish mode comes in., The AI is ferocious: occasionally rushing, sometimes holding back with a mixed army., On medium, most players will find it a challenge., You?re also free to create mixed matches of human and AI players, or pitch AI s against each other., The results are fascinating, and a near perfect training ground for online., Which is where the other fun begins., Multiplayer
I think many new players are nervous about venturing online ? particularly given the reputation of pro-players., In practice, the new Battle.net delivers excellent matchmaking and leagues, for teams of up to four., The sides feel relatively evenly matched, and any cheesy rushes have easy-to-remember counters., There are far more Terran players online in the lower leagues, presumably thanks to the campaign serving as an extended training level, but they?re certainly not dominating., Banshees can cloak, rendering large primitive forces useless., Millions of words will be expended on whether certain units or combinations and counters are unbalanced., They can be summed up in one sentence: StarCraft II is more than ready for competitive gaming., What imbalances there were have been addressed in a long, long beta period., The best way of describing the joy of StarCraft II online is this: even if you win, you are usually left exhausted., The mental effort required to scout your opponent, match their economy, deliver a counter and execute a plan will leave you drained and broken., If you lose, the mental effort is the same, sometimes greater., But you never leave unhappy., You simply want to learn where you went wrong, how you can improve and what to change next time., If I win, I want to jump back in and prove myself again., If I lose, I want to try again, maybe a different build order, maybe scout earlier., New or nervous players have plenty of opportunity to learn in the Practice League., These early matches are played on modified maps (most block off the entrance to your base, to prevent an early rush), and don?t contribute to your overall ranking., But when the bug finally gets to you, you can skip them and head right to your placement matches., There, you?re dropped into regional leagues and matched with players of broadly similar skill., Yes, StarCraft is fiercely competitive., But the community is largely friendly and receptive., Most matches online are preceded by a ?glhf?, and the losers ? even AI players ? will sign off with a ?gg?., And that?s the point., It is a good game., It?s a great game., Playing it, repelling wave upon wave of Zerg forces in the singleplayer levels, bullying your way into the league rankings in the relentless multiplayer leagues, or just hanging about in the luxurious campaign front-end, is to be reminded that PC gaming has always been the most vital, and most exciting platform on the planet., A gloriously well crafted campaign welded to a near Olympic competitive experience., StarCraft II is practically essential., StarCraft II airlines take to the skies, Posted, You can subscribe to comments., Starcraft 2 Zerg

has come close to matching the strategy, the addictiveness, and gameplay of Starcraft II., Not Halo 3, Not CounterStrike,
heck not even BioShock., I tried the beta for the past month, and am glad to say that Blizzard took their time
to produce a great followup to the first Starcraft., We're talking vastly improved sound, graphics, and gameplay., Some of 
the more talk worthy improvements they made to Starcraft II is that you get to pick as many units as you desire., I've tried
some of the new units, and the renovated old ones, and all of them are fun as heck to control., I recommend getting this game
if you were into the first one - it has everything I loved about the first Starcraft, as well as its own distinct flavor., Whether you're playing the single campaign or multiplayer, you're sure to have hours and hours of fun playing this game., Looking forward to seeing you all online on July 27!, The countdown begins..., Starcraft 2 Reviews., All rights reserved., by Allen Cook  on Jul 28th 2010 1:31PM, StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty isn't just traditional, it's a tradition., If any other company but Blizzard had simply put new graphics over the same old interface, it would have resulted in an interesting novelty at best., But within moments of putting my hands on StarCraft 2 during the open beta, it was clear this was no mere novelty., It's been more than a decade since I played the original, but the sequel feels both instantly fresh and familiar., It's not a game that will be forgotten in the rush of the coming months' releases., It feels timeless., Starcraft 2 (6/29/09)While the multiplayer was available for months in beta, the single-player Terran-only campaign of Wings of Liberty has remained a mystery., In short, it's a return to form for Blizzard, with a sweeping story told through gorgeous cutscenes and varied missions that fall along a pitch-perfect difficulty curve., The world of StarCraft is brought to life with a rare attention to detail, with original recorded songs like "A Zerg, A Shotgun and You" playing on the jukebox, memorabilia from protagonist Jim Raynor's previous exploits lining the walls and commercials for "Bubba's Gas and Grub" flashing by on the background TVs., There are several updates to the single-player campaign to keep it feeling contemporary, many of which will be recognized by fans of Relic's Dawn of War 2., A branching mission structure, unlockable upgrades and single-player-only units and abilities all combine to make the campaign feel like more than a series of skirmishes., In traditional Blizzard form, the developer borrows from the best., Blizzard didn't change StarCraft, because StarCraft didn't need changing., Though the budget and spectacle have clearly increased since the first game, what's most striking about the single-player game is the familiarity., The standard missions are all there -- stealth, base defense and straight-up battles -- and the core strategies still work., Blizzard didn't change StarCraft, because StarCraft didn't need changing., As for multiplayer in StarCraft 2, it's one of the most finely-honed experiences I've ever played., In order to live up to the legacy of StarCraft's professional gaming scene, Blizzard couldn't just settle for making the game "reasonably" balanced., The results of months of tweaks in open beta can be seen in a wonderfully balanced multiplayer experience -- every strategy seems to have a viable counter strategy, and at higher levels of play no single strategy dominates., StarCraft has always rewarded skill and creativity in a way few strategy games ever have, and its sequel continues this legacy., The constant tinkering and re-balancing that went into the game wasn't limited to the unit-balance., The matchmaking system has seen similar love., You play in a few "placement matches" to determine your skill level, then the matchmaking secret-sauce algorithm pairs you with an opponent of similar skill., It's hopelessly addictive., Similarly to the way a character gains levels in World of Warcraft, there's a continual string of wins to offset your defeats., This constant feedback of skirmishes against similarly skilled opponents is a staple of competitive StarCraft play, and Battle.net 2.0 consistently linked me to competitive matches., Even losses can be rewarding, as the excellent and improved replay system allows you to watch your opponent's strategy and learn to counter it., Replays have always been critical to competitive StarCraft players, and StarCraft 2 makes this invaluable tool easily accessible to everyone., Published on 29th July 2010 by Harry Butler, Tax)

Game developers seem to be constantly trying to reinvent or leave their unique mark on a genre., Just look at how recharging health has spread in first person shooters, or dynamic cover systems in third person action games., It?s a sign of progress, with each game building on the good ideas and foundations of those that have come before it to strive for greatness., StarCraft 2 does not believe in progress., It looks at all the advances in the RTS genre since the original?s 1998 release ? unique hero units, dynamic cover, simplified resource gathering, complex hit boxes ? and goes completely the other way., This is what we?d imagine an RTS would be like if the developers had been shut away from the outside world for the last ten years., Resource gathering?, Double check., We suspect the launch party may have been marred as bleary eyed coders and play testers stood open mouthed at the news of the first black president, a decade of the war on terror and the death Michael Jackson., Yet while these creaking, aged game mechanics have been increasingly abandoned or altered as time?s gone on, Blizzard has somehow taken the old, tired recipe from the shelf and whipped up a game of simply awesome quality., The experience starts from the very second you start installing the game., With twelve years having passed since the original was released, some younger players won?t have a clue what's gone before in this game's universe, so we?re treated to a plot-re-cap as the progress bar teases its way forwards., It?s needed too, as the StarCraft universe is seriously ambitious in its plot and storyline., Rebels, two alien races, emperors, billions of casualties, love, loyalty, loss and betrayal ? and that?s before the game?s even installed., Managing such a complex and varied plot would be a challenge for any game, let alone a conventional RTS, where the player?s connection to their units is so difficult to forge and the gameplay itself tends to jump from mission to mission., StarCraft 2?s solution is to give players a whole lot more to do in between levels than customise load-outs or pick the next target., With the player in the role of rebel space rogue commander type Jim Raynor, you?ve got a whole battlecruiser at your disposal and there?s plenty to do aboard when not splatting alien bug monsters or trying to overthrow governments., Downtime is spent between four areas of the ship, conversing with the crew in a point and click style, buying upgrades for units, researching new technologies, hiring mercenaries, listening to Lynyrd Skynyrd cover bands on the bar?s jukebox, watching the ?fair and balanced? news or even playing on the bar?s excellent shoot-?em-up mini game, Lost Viking., It all subtly deepens your involvement in the game world and means that StarCraft 2 rarely suffers from plot update overload or the feeling of mission to mission grind., There?s always something new to see or hear and some of the game?s best and funniest dialogue can be found on the decks of the ship or around the Cantina bar., StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty release date announced, IT Pro, ? Copyright Dennis Publishing Limited licensed by Felden, 21 CommentsRead all 21 commentsIt's true you can't play the game without an internet connection - but honestly how many people out there have a computer capable of playing new release games, but don't have an internet connection?, Well there are some people who for example get stuck in a hotel for a week for work, and would like to play it in the evening ..., There will always be a situation where an Internet connection might not be available ..., What about if my connection goes at home for some reason ..., Does that stop me playing other games .., no it doesn;t even Steam games can be played offline ..., It's a valid concern .., that's not touched here but brushed over ...One of those pictures looks suspiciously like an Astartes in terminator armour.Well, if you're going to steal it, steal it from the best and make it damn cool while you're at it.Flawlessly balanced.Like all the great multiplayer games, like Quake III Arena, CS,

single player campaign as you could'nt log on., Signing in as a guest only allows to start a new campaign.Its a pretty good game and the story for an RTS is excellent, the only thing im not keen on is that most levels make you rush your ass off to complete objectives and you dont get a chance to build up research and forces, just feels like your hanging in there all the time., the resorce gavering is also very tedious and a bit old school but hey ho its still fun and looks fantastic with me gtx480., so far is a solid 8 for me.So, a game that's a rehash of a 12-year old game, with updated graphics, new campaigns and units, and absolutely nothing *new* or groundbreaking, is the pinnacle of RTS gaming?Wow., Must suck to be Relic, or one of the others that have given us great games that expanded the genre., I know SC2 is catering to tournament play, but for "wargamers" there's nothing there., Can you hear units through the fog of war (like CoH?)., Shall I go on?I'm sure it's a great game if that's your thing, but to me this is another amazingly well made, and well polished, Blizzard game., They're fantastic at just that., But such a high score?, I'm thinking if this game had been released by someone else, not called Starcraft, and had had three other races, it would receive decent reviews, but come under massive flak for being essentially a 12 year old game mechanic with fancier graphics., I'm not fanboy-ing against Blizzard - I deeply admire their skill in making easily accessible games that are deeply addictive to so many players., For that, they'd get a solid 10., I just prefer giving more credit (and better scores) to those who push the boundaries, invent something new, and bring something to the table.Those are valid points, but frankly I think 'pushing the boundaries' is overrated., Or maybe it is oversimplified., Games like Company of Heroes and SupCom are very good, and they push the boundaries in the sense that they present new mechanics for RTSs., But the fact is that these new mechanics wear out after a while., After playing through all the campaigns of CoH with the expansions I can say I'm bored to death of it, and have been so since the very first campaign., There are new mechanics but nothing more than that, the game never takes itself further than inventing some new way to play., That's not enough.Blizzard's innovation isn't in introducing some new mechanic and forming an entire game around it., That's never been their staple., What they do is take existing mechanics and use those in interesting new ways, taking into account everything that's the absolute best., This is what SC2 is., Their starting point of design is the final point for most developers., They take the mechanic and push it in new directions., Thus, every single mission is different in the game, every encounter interesting., Every level has something for the player to notice and learn.It doesn't just make up some new way to play and grind it to dust, it really tries to challenge the player in a different way every single time., That's why SC2 is the pinnacle of RTS gaming.@the688Some of the terrain is destructible, but not all of it - i.e, you can destroy a wall in order to open up a new route through the map., It's not large-scale, but it does give a variety of tactics on many of the multiplayer maps (do you blow up this wall to get easier access to those minerals knowing that it will also give easier access to your base by the enemy?, etc).Line of Sight and weapons range is height-dependant, with your LOS increased on higher ground, and your units unable to fire or see up long ramps.There is a day/night cycle in place, but from what I've played so far it is only used in certain single-player scenarios to introduce more varied objectives and mechanics.Just letting you know.when Battle.net went down for maintenance on Wed I was denied to continue my single player campaign as you could'nt log on., Signing in as a guest only allows to start a new campaign.I thought you were permitted to play offline as long as you had already set up your character on Battle.net?It is pretty ridiculous though the fact that it has to connect to the internet for every little thing., For almost anything you click on in the main menu, there's a few second delay while it goes off telling Blizzard's paranoia server about everything you're doing.One more reason why MUST have internet connection is a dumb idea no wonder pc gaming is dying, you dont get crap like this on consoles.Wait what?, You gave it points for Bnet.20?SC2 7/10There are two more SCII expansions coming down the line - one focusing on the Protoss and one on the Zerg., Again, Blizzard has taken a bit of initial flack for providing a 'third of a game,' but these complaints are somewhat less valid., Hello, new member here - I enjoyed this review (one of the precious few out there so far) but I had to make a point about the comment shown above.I for one don't consider this an 'incomplete" game - as you stated it is clearly fully functional and probably has even more to it than I expected., In my mind the point is that the money paid for any stand-alone game pays for the marketing, the engine, the scripting, the acting, etc., The following two game will use the same engine and will require little or no marketing so how can they justify charging full market price?The answer I'm sure is that they can because they know people will pay that price but that sounds a lot more like a $30 value than $60.I thought you were permitted to play offline as long as you had already set up your character on Battle.net?, yes, you can play offline as a guest (campaign, ai skirmishes ) but because of achievements and the worry of people "cheating" to get them, I have to be online to play my campaign., For anything to count towards your stats and personal records regarding single player and multiplayer you have to be connected to a battle.net server.That must be some kind of strong crack you guys are smoking to give it a 93., The Single player is like an extended Babylon 5 and really isn't that engaging a story., It doesn't have the big sweep or grandeur of it predecessor., The missions, I have done most of them to death a 1000 times over., The graphics are no great leap from it's 12yr old father., Gameplay wise a tank rush still wins the day., Every evolution of the genre has been ignored., I feel like Marty Mcfly I've gone so far into the past., I can't comment on Multiplayer as it's not my thing to go up against click happy speed machines., Finally Why the **** do I have to be connected to the net to play single player., We gave Ubisoft a rocket up the rear for this, but it's ok for the almighty Blizzard to do the same., Sorry it's not., The reviews to date have been shamefully skewed by fanboyisim., It's worth a 83 at best.Take at look at Tychos's power armourthe chest plate.SIMBA!!!!!!!So...how much do we need to reduce the score to compensate for hype and Blizzards weird ability to get unjustified scores for their games?I'm thinking about one and half maybe two points?, Not that Starcraft 2 is a bad game but to give it a near perfect score in a review that points out several major issues., Mostly that it looks/feels/plays like a game from the 90s.They've completely ignored the advances other games have made in the genre, including their own., Warcraft 3 for example managed to keep you engaged with the main characters by making them playable units on the battlefield, a feature which SC2 seems to have abandoned for the most part., It has none of the scale of the Supreme Commander games, none of pace of Dawn Of War and none of the innovation of World In Conflict.The missions are stale, as stated in the review, some of them are lifted straight out of the original C&C and Warcraft games., The graphics are mediocre at best., As for the plot, it's not complex, it's convoluted, as Chris Metzen derived games always are., Constant unexplained shifts in characters demeanor from "good" to "bad" and back again, and the constant betrayals and alliances...that isn't an complex story, it's a lazy story., As with Warcraft it's a story that can't justify it's characters actions so it falls back to cliches like possession, prophacies and higher powers.Also, as Ronin pointed out, Ubisoft were made into pariahs for their internet only single player yet when Blizzard do it no one bats an eyelid., A tad hypocritical don't you think?All in all it's a good enough game, but if it were called anything else or if it was made by any other company it would be fading into obscurity within a year.Flawlessly balanced.SFIII,If only..., >_<SSFIV is way more balanced than any of the IIIs if you wanna go down that road unfortunately.As far as SC2 goes, I never played the first but picked up the second thanks to all the hype and am thoroughly enjoying it so far.Can't wait to get raeped by a 2 year old Korean online.So, a game that's a rehash of a 12-year old game, with updated graphics, new campaigns and units, and absolutely nothing *new* or groundbreaking, is the pinnacle of RTS gaming?Wow., Must suck to be Relic, or one of the others that have given us great games that expanded the genre., I know SC2 is catering to tournament play, but for "wargamers" there's nothing there., Can you hear units through the fog of war (like CoH?)., Shall I go on?I'm sure it's a great game if that's your thing, but to me this is another amazingly well made, and well polished, Blizzard game., They're

that are deeply addictive to so many players., For that, they'd get a solid 10., I just prefer giving more credit (and better scores) to those who push the boundaries, invent something new, and bring something to the table.This.Maybe its just not my type of RTS., I have played it and it is a solid well made game with the usual highly polished gameplay but does it really warrant such hype and high scores considering they themselves say its SC1 with some new bits and bobs and upgraded graphics.Only Blizzard could get away with an upgraded 12yo game getting these kind of scores.Quite a few actually., I do have an internet connection but for certain reasons I only have a couple of gigs a month on a mobile plan (for now)., That means I cannot waste what usage I have on any game that requires constant connection., I understand constant connection for multi-player but as I prefer the single player campaigns there is absolutely no point in me buying this game., I sympathise with the anti-piracy plight of the industry but I doubt constant connection is the way to go (unless the phone companies give every person on the planet FREE internet connection....constantly).I'm not any "sport/sort" of person, just someone who has been stopped from buying a game because I will be unable to use it., i really like this game its a cool rts .and it still a million times better than the crap c&c4, at least you can build a base something i miss out of the new warhammer II gamesFor the record, you CAN play offline if you've already registered once., I just checked this myself., You won't be able to earn achievements or play the online (duh) multiplayer, but you can still play., Maybe not a constant connection, but finding a statistically relevant number of Starcraft 2 prospective players that have NO ACCESS to internet at all is a fools errand.And, as someone said before, Blizzard is a refiner, not an innovator., How much of WoW can you say is innovative?, It's still the most successful MMO out there., Because it's polished to hell and back, and they got their game right the first time., By forgoing innovation for development, you give yourself more time to make sure everything is right., Why does it get so much high scores?, Because scoring isn't based on how much new shiny baubles you put into a game., StarCraft 2 review, Looking at StarCraft 2, we wonder why the hell Blizzard placed a patch-enforced worldwide review blackout., Still, it?s given us ample time to put together the most definitive StarCraft 2 review on the Internet?, Publisher:

Released: Out Now
You can never go back to a state of grace, they say., No matter what you try, time and toil make it impossible to reclaim the joy and sense of wonder you had when things were new., As life-long gamers we?d be inclined to agree; there?s just a sense that as time goes by, we become more difficult to impress ? give us something new or take it away., Well, what they say is wrong; with StarCraft II we?ve been taken back to a time when the RTS genre was a joy; tightly crafted, challenging, yet accessible and entertaining., You?re going to hear a lot of lazy talk about how Blizzard has effectively just re-skinned and updated the formula that made the original StarCraft such a phenomenal success, but that?s mostly wrong, and largely missing the point
Yes, the heart of the old gameplay is here, featuring StarCraft II?s three finely balanced races, the rednecks-in-space Terrans, the hideous, alien Zerg, and the technological/Psi-based warrior race, the Protoss., This is still a traditional RTS in which you?ll gather resources, build a base, develop your technology, and destroy the enemy but Blizzard have taken the formula that they perfected twelve years ago and given it an astounding level of polish and refinement., The first of which is new way StarCraft II?s epic story is told., While StarCraft was famous for its great brief cut-scenes most of its story was told in-game via talking heads., It?s often difficult for real time strategy games to get their narrative across and really connect missions with story., In StarCraft II, though, your ship ? The Hyperion ? serves as a point and click adventure hub in four areas; the Bridge, the Cantina, the Armoury and the Laboratory., In between missions, you?ll use these areas to talk to the motley crew you?ve gathered., And there?s a hell of a story to be told here., It charts the fortunes of lead character Jim Raynor, as he fights to bring down the despotic Dominion, survive the Zerg onslaught, and battle with his inner demons from the loss of his lover, Kerrigan (to the Zerg swarm, where she survives as the Queen of Blades and plots the destruction of humanity)., The highly polished interactive areas all have elements you can play with (our favourite is the Cantina, with it?s jukebox playing StarCraft versions of southern rock anthems such as like Sweet Home Alabama and sweet Lost Vikings arcade game), but you?ll eagerly return after each mission for the character conversations in each that drive the narrative., It?s a tale told with a truly superb script and wonderful voice work (with music to die for)., It all goes to making you care that much more about Raynor?s battle to save humanity., There?s also some narrative gameplay choice ? as with missions requiring you to either side with, or against crewmembers determining whether they stay with you or leave, taking their technical advantages with them and changing the story., It all just gives StarCraft II greater narrative depth, as well as further replay value., This is a level of love and polish that works its way into StarCraft II?s gameplay in so many ways, elevating its way above core genre concepts., While things that RTS gamers may have gotten used to in StarCraft II?s contemporary genre stable-mates, (facing and cover aren?t here), StarCraft II has its own nuances, like line-of-sight and rate of fire., And, there?s countless RPG unit effects, like healing, splash damage, and the ability to slow your enemies., It?s the versatility of the units you field that makes it such fun, with old friends like Marines and Siege Tanks joined by the transforming Viking or massive Thor Walker., There?s an underlying rock, scissors, paper mechanic to be sure, it?s just that you have several varieties in each category., But, once you start to get to grips with it, things become second nature and that?s when choice and play-style begin to deepen the experience., What?s astounding about the StarCraft II campaign in particular, is just how tight the mission design actually is., We?d be hard-pressed to point to an RTS with as great a flair for it, or one which ramps up quite so well., It seems that Blizzard really took to heart the fact that it would effectively be re-introducing the genre to a whole new unsuspecting generation, but that, rather than dumb down the concept as others have, (yes, we?re looking at you Command & Conquer 4), they chose to create a perfectly gentle curve that would both teach, and challenge., Did you enjoy this article?, Follow NowGamer on  for all the latest videogames news, reviews, previews, interviews, features, opinion and a whole more., Our  fan page is the best place to communicate with other fans of the NowGamer website., Jezcentral   said:, The game starts easy, but the difficulty ramps up nicely., Yes, the game mechanics may be as old as the hills, but the presentation,, game design and story telling is top-notch., Folks
I?m not sure if you?re aware that Starcraft II is cooking some graphics cards?, I wasn?t either until a few days after I loaded SCII and my $600 card died., The local shop said it was likely to be caused by heat, and so a little investigation later and I discover it?s a known problem (since Beta)., http://www.tomshardware.com/news/starcraft-overheating,10984.html
There?s enough feedback flying around the web to know this isn?t a once-off., It?s frustrating given that the fix is simple and it?s been known since Beta., Anyway, thought you might like to warn other readers and hopefully save them the cost of a new graphics card., Jezcentral   said:, I?m in no position to doubt your veracity, but yours is the first example, that I?ve heard of, of a card expiring that wasn?t in a laptop, and a ?$600 card? should have better cooling., Whether I?m in the Cantina (where the problem is) and my 4890 is generating hundreds of FPS, or in the Mission screen, when it?s only producing 40-50 FPS with everything turned up to ultra, my card is working as hard as it can., introspective   said:, SC sequel is similar like original, there is no major changes., The graphics has been updated a few units added., Still, game is good and enjoyable., It reminds me on good old times., Welcome to T3.com, StarCraft 2 review, Posted by Andrew Wooden on Fri 6 Aug 2010, 12 years is a long time in anyone's calendar - and the PC gaming landscape is a very different place to what it was in 1998., ?
StarCraft, essentially a sci-fi version of Blizzard's early fantasy-based C&C rival Warcraft 2., With an appealing sci-fi setting and the twist of including three factions instead of two, it achieved a legacy which is almost unheard of in gaming., To this day, the fanaticism showed now signs of abating., Were it not for the arrival of its sequel StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, selling a whopping? 5 million copies in its first day,
?
Check our our StarCraft 2 pictures here:

?
In StarCraft II, you play as one of three races., The Terrans - humans with customisable, oversized, steam-punk mechanics and guns; the Zerg, hive mind Giger-esque insectoid monstrosities; and the Protoss - telepathic, telekinetic aliens with hyper-advanced weaponry and the smugness to back it up., ?
As RTS games go, StarCraft II is a very traditional affair., The basic mechanics will be instantly familiar to anyone who's ever played a game in the genre., If you exist in the tiny demographic of PC gamers that haven't, it goes like this..., ?
Originally published on CVG here: StarCraft 2 review
?
In almost all scenarios, you start with a command centre and a few worker units with which to mine resources - in this case diamond-like minerals and vespine gas., You use these to construct buildings, which in turn produce military units., ?
You then use said military units to blow the enemy into its component atoms before tapping out one of many fine 'noob' based insults you've been working on., ?
StarCraft 2: The plot
?
The plot picks up where the StarCraft add-on Brood War left off., Set around 500 years in the future, you play through the eyes of Jim Raynor - a refugee and with a cowboy's swagger who's been on the run causing terrorist/freedom-fighting shenanigans since the events in the first game, where he fell out with the tyrannical emperor of the human race., ?
Raynor has a bit of a chip on his shoulder., In the last game the love of his life, special ops assassin-type Kerrigan, got captured by the Zerg., She was brainwashed and then physically mutated into a super-strong villainess, who then took over as ruler of the insectoid race and stopped just short of wiping out all human life in the galaxy., ?
The emperor himself, Mengsk, is a sort of space hick with a Texan drawl, who was busy spending the empire's resources on tracking down Raynor - until the Zerg menace reared its salivating head again after four years of remission., As a result, everyone goes for their guns., ?
The storyline is pretty complex for a video game, and while it is sometimes blighted by the usual cheesy dialogue you'd expect from the medium, it's engrossing enough that the frequent CGI movies which roll the story along throughout the campaign never feel like an imposition., ?
Wings of Liberty's single-player campaign is mainly concerned with the Terran perspective, and the 30 or so missions will see you defending convoys, holding out from invasion until an evacuation can be arranged, espionage into enemy territory with a couple of elite units, or just levelling an Zerg base Raynor doesn't like the look of., ?
StarCraft didn't remain one of the most played games for 12 years because of its single player campaign., The real meat of StarCraft was, and remains, the multiplayer., ?
StarCraft 2: Mulitiplayer

Even in early stages of combat with the game's most basic units, the three races manage to remain so utterly distinct, yet perfectly balanced.., Whether you choose Terran, Zerg or Protoss, it's always a fair fight., ?
It's here that your own interpretation of play becomes all-important., You'll get to learn which tactics work best for you., Will you concentrate on building a lot of barracks straight away and rustle up a massed marine/marauder strike force quickly?, Or will you turtle up and sit behind your defences until you've prepared a devastating fleet of massed Protoss Void Rays?, Either way, prepare for it to be countered., If there's one this thing the multiplayer game isn't, it's forgiving., ?
The best players learn to adapt quickly, and take full advantage of some of the more powerful unit's special abilities in the heat of a battle., These include the Protoss Templar's psyonic storm, which can cause havoc in the middle of an enemy rush, and the Terran Ghost's ability to laser in a strategic nuke attack at the heart of an enemy's defensive line., It's tough to start with, but you don't mind losing - with the replay functions there's always something to learn in defeat., ?
StarCraft 2: Future games
?
There are two more SCII expansions coming down the line - one focusing on the Protoss and one on the Zerg., Blizzard has taken a bit of initial flack for providing a 'third of a game,' but these complaints are somewhat less valid., ?
The single-player offering features a 30 mission campaign representing many, many hours of gaming., On top of that, there's full working multiplayer, a complete map editor and even more far-reaching customisable features., Only those with disproportionately high expectations could consider Wings of Liberty anything other than a full game., ?
The other main genuine complaint is that the game has the potential to be a bit buggy at times., This is a fair point, though really it's very rare that a software crash occurs - and we understand Blizzard are working on it

StarCraft 2: Conclusion
?
StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is in many ways is the culmination of the RTS genre to date., It takes the best of what has come before, and tightens it up into a totally accessible, yet deceptively complex pinnacle., ?
Like all great games its easy to learn, and very difficult to master., It's traditional, slick, accomplished; perfectly balanced gameplay will likely keep it on the competitive gaming scene for many years to come, and with good reason., As one of the most anticipated games of all time, it doesn't disappoint., The shortlist is in for the 2010 T3 Gadget Awards

		??, Blizzard held something important back when it loosed its real-time strategy PC game StarCraft II on the public this Tuesday:, Wondering why only a handful in the press have reviewed the game days after launch?, That's why., Blizzard decided it wanted everyone to have the game simultaneously., It decided this because StarCraft II's online component probably matters more than its single-player one, and it wanted the media to play in the "real world" with the general public., No "exclusive" handshakes with online press or cover story quid pro quos with print mags., It's a pretty bold (and in my opinion, laudatory) move on the company's part., It lets us experience the game the way you're experiencing it and react representatively., It also quashes favoritism, allays concerns we're playing beta and not final code, and eliminates the appearance of impropriety when an "exclusive" early review reads like a honey-drizzled confectionary., Sure, it means you don't have guideline verdicts at launch, but the review delay amounts to a couple of days, and those whose buy decisions hinge on bloggy screeds or aggregator scores can probably stand to wait., So the StarCraft II reviews are slowly rolling in, and the sentiments are pretty predictable: General prose plaudits about the single campaign and exhaustive multiplayer components, some griping over absent LAN-play, shrugs about the familiar game design, and the conventional wisdom that Blizzard innovates less than it reworks and polishes., Cut, save, and paste whenever Diablo 3 ships., Your reviews, on the other hand, have been rolling in since you picked up the game on Tuesday, posted to boards and blogs and buy sites everywhere., Heard about the Amazon user review split?, It continues, now with about 250 reviewers praising the game, opposed by another 250 users slamming it., You'd think the game was a candidate in the upcoming mid-term elections., On the Blizzard StarCraft II boards, you can find...well, nothing as of this posting., I can't get the StarCraft II boards to come up ("An error was encountered while processing your request") and Battle.net still lists them as in beta., Last I looked, people's opinions ran the gamut., At NeoGAF, the largest dedicated gaming board online, guys who spend at least 25 hours a day calculating stuff like the precise distance a Protoss cannon fires in pixels seem to love the game, or particular aspects of it., "Man, can't stress how amazing scouting is," writes one user., "For instance: Early scout notices ramp is too wide to block off and they went cyber instead of 2gate.", "I decide to make a reaper first unit and move to Helions., Reaper gets inside their base, notices a stargate already getting chrono boosted., So I pump marines while getting Helions., A void ray arrives at my front, and I'm able to hold it off easily., Helions get inside the main and notice that he's decided to ditch void and go mass stalkers against my rines., Able to stave off the attack without losing base, helions rush in to counter attack, gg.", If you understood less than half of that, don't feel bad., After all, you can enjoy a game like Madden NFL without knowing what alligator arms, slobber-knockers, and pooch punts are., IGN's boards offer a few random comments about the game, the occasional complaint, and a clutch of technical inquiries, but my favorite has to be:, "Do you think someone will die playing StarCraft 2?", Sure, and it'll happen on precisely December 21, 2012., Follow me on Twitter (@game_on), Would you

upgraded, and new unit types., Unparalleled online play for StarCraft II will be available through a new version of Battle.net, Blizzard Entertainment's world-renowned gaming service., Battle.net has been redesigned from the ground up to be the premier online gaming destination for Blizzard gamers, with several enhancements and new features, such as voice communication, cloud file storage, leagues and ladders, achievements, stat-tracking, and more., The solo campaign for StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty will continue the epic saga where it left off in StarCraft: Brood War?., The story line chronicles the exploits of marshal-turned-rebel-leader Jim Raynor and features both familiar faces and new heroes., Players will be able to tailor the experience, choosing their own mission path and

players into the basics of multiplayer strategies., StarCraft II is what I've always wanted out of an RTS - fantastic graphics, well integrated story, interesting units, and wildly different factions., It manages to be thoroughly modern while remaining true to its roots, and creates an engaging and utterly replayable experience., Go to Review ?, Lead Designer Dustin Browder and Lead

Review July 30, 2010 TweetShareSoftSailor is Giving Away a 32GB iPad and a 32GB iPhone., Click here to grab yours now !Starcraft 2 is one of the most anticipated game releases of 2010., On the 27th of July, Blizzard Entertainment finally releases Wings of Liberty which is the first episode of Starcraft 2 Universe Saga., As the game was highly-anticipated, it did sell out of stores but Blizzard fans are not satisfied with the game at all, over 300.000 petitions were sent to Blizzard because it doesn???t have a LAN Mode.Blizzard responded that there will never be a LAN Mode in Starcraft 2., All the previous Blizzard Games who had a LAN Mode are played with the famous GArena, this will encourage more players to not buy the product and simply play freely online without wasting any money and not supporting the developer., This is one of the main reasons why Blizzard didn???t make a LAN Mode, but the thing that bothers me most is that you can???t play with your friend in US if you are in Europe., You have to buy two versions and make two different accounts: on US and EU if you want to play with everybody., Starcraft I and Warcraft 3 had 4 choices whether to connect to US East, US West, Europe or Asia so that everybody could have met on battle.net., Imagine how heartbreaking it would be for two faraway friends who played together predecessor Blizzard games on battle.net and now they can???t anymore.Part two and three of the Saga will be released also this year in order to complete the sequel, they will be at the same price of 60$., If you don???t want to play the campaign its fine, don???t buy it, you will still be able to play on battle.net., Other buyers don???t understand why they have to be online in order to play the campaign which has nothing to do with the internet but an achievement system is now available like in World of Warcraft., You have a customizable profile account with unique features and ranking., As many achievements points you gain from completing achievements inside missions or challenges, your rank will grow and you can unlock different things such as portraits, banners.The GameplayWell enough bragging about Starcraft 2., Let???s see why the game???s value is over the $60 you paid out of your pocket., Starcraft 2 is really a mixture between the first Starcraft and Warcraft 3, this hybrid is the best thing Blizzard could have come up with., You have simple functions of an RTS combined with the original epic gameplay from Starcraft and a much more complicated micro-management then Warcraft 3., A lot of units have special abilities now, making them a unique tool on the battlefield, nearly all the units have a distinctive characteristic that can change your battle outcome.Starcraft 2 is on a faster pace than the predecessors, the resource gathering is pretty fast and simple, players build fast and attack fast, and you don???t have time to choose whether to build this or that first., In starcraft2, more Vespene gas is available and you can fight for strategic resource points that are filled with special minerals for your SCV, probes and drones to gather., The depletions messages are very annoying; for every mineral is depleted an audio alert will come up every time.There are very few players who are not familiar to Blizzard???s RTS so people will really know how to play this game., I myself had the chance to play the Beta for quite some time and I have a head-start to those who are new to the game., People still apply classic strategies from the first Starcraft and enhance their strategy with micro-management, there are many tactical combinations possible when a team is made out of two or three different races.The Balance between racesA question that I hear all the time from different people since I was playing the beta is which race has the upper hand?, Starcraft is well known for its attribute of the balance between the three races, but the last patch was released in 2009 January so Blizzard will watch very carefully how Starcraft 2 progresses so they can change unbalanced units or upgrades in future patches., The Feedback from the Beta version helped Blizzard balance the races very well for the first version, the beta testing was a success., Conclusion, no race has the upper hand right now thanks to the Beta, so Blizzard will make minor changes to units and upgrades.The GUIThe Interface of the game is very user-friendly and beautifully done., After your Log-in screen you have a panel with all sorts of different options to choose from., You have the Single Player Tab, where you can start your Terran Campaign, take challenges or battle the AI., The ???Challenge??? feature provokes the player like in a game of chess, you are placed in different situations with a limited amount of firepower and you have to complete the objective given, a medal system is a available for how efficient your strategy was.Main MenuThe first time you enter the multiplayer tab; a message will appear and ask you if you want to play in the ???newbie zone??? online with other players at a low game speed., A cooperative game is available for players who can team up online and battle the AI without influencing their online rankings; it is very useful for learning the basic functions and strategies when playing in a team., A lot of people get frustrated when they get a random new player in their team; basically this avoids events like such to happen., A Quick match is available, you just choose what type of match you would like to play 1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, 4vs4 and your preferred race or random, just like in Warcraft 3.The Terran CampaignThe story gets pick-up on Mar Sara, the famous Marshall Jim Raynor is currently planning on getting control of Mar Sara from the Dominion., His arch-enemy Arthur Mengsk, leader of the Dominion, outlawed him, he was forced to flee into the desert of Mar Sara while his Hyperion orbits the planet., On his battle against the dominion, a friend Thycus broke out of the dominion prison, he offers him an artifact hunt on different planets., By selling the Xel???Naga artifacts on the black-market, Jim Raynor can fund his war against the Dominion., Jim Raynor possesses a Battle cruiser called the Hyperion., After each mission you can interact in four different rooms around the Hyperion:The BridgeThe armory ??? Where you can spend credits on upgrading your units with special skills and attributes., You can enhance buildings as well with fortified features.The Bridge ??? In the bridge you can see the mission archives where you can find all the missions you have accomplished plus cinematic movies, you can replay any mission you would like if you want to get all the achievements., The Star Map is also present at the bridge; from there you can select your next missions.The Cantina ??? Is a recreation zone for the personal, you can watch the news and recruit mercenaries which are used in your missions, certain trophies from missions are hanged around the cantina also you have a silly arcade game you can play.The CantinaThe Laboratory ??? is split up in to two branches, the Protoss and the Zerg., In missions if you complete the secondary objectives, you gain Protoss or Zerg research points., You can use your research points to combine Terran with Protoss and Zerg technology., For example, you can research the technology of teleporting canisters of Vespene Gas, no SCVs are needed to gather and you can place refineries all over the map.ResearchingThe Storyline is very impressive, especially the end., I won???t discuss any detail from the storyline, I will let you discover it by yourselves but be assured that Blizzard???s imagination has not let us down.The Multiplayer???Speechless., If your workers are missing from their everyday jobs, don???t blame any mysterious flu, blame Starcraft 2., The gameplay online is different from the predecessor Blizzard games, the combination between Starcraft and Warcraft 3 really emphasizes the feeling of the game; it gives the player countless tactical strategies., You can add players that you encounter on battle.net to friends and play with them in future games., A built-in talk options is available to speak to your teammates which is very well optimized, so you don???t have to waste your time anymore with ventrilo and other programs., Leagues and tournaments will be available soon; there will be different types of game modes, from 1vs1 to 4vs4., So you can build up a team of RTS veterans and conquer the battle.net.1 vs 1ConclusionStarcraft 2 is a complete real-time strategy game with great visual graphics, enhanced online gameplay, it offers an epic storyline filled with fantasy worlds and amazing character intrigues., The successor of the original Starcraft and Warcraft 3 will echo for another decade.Also Blizzard Entertainment declares some changes in the following patches that will come:http://www.softsailor.com/news/35738-starcraft-2-changes-in-future-patch.htmlStarcraft 2   TweetShare Related PostsStarcraft 2 Beta Key Wave 4 is a possibility, Dustin Browder interviewAdditional Starcraft 2 Beta Keys Sent To Players That Are Already Beta-TestingStarcraft 2 Beta Coming To a MAC Near You, No Starcraft 2 Open Beta PlannedStarcraft 2 Wings of Liberty Release Date Announced?FinallyStarcraft 2 Wings of Liberty Beta testing is open: Signup nowStarcraft 2 Beta review hand made by CNNStarcraft 2 Beta Patch 9 to bring the Map Editor, Starcraft 2 Mac Beta coming soonStarcraft 2 Beta Key Giveaway on FacebookPosted in Game Reviews, GamesTHIS POST WAS WRITTEN BY:Cristian MasalaComments ( 19 )Leave a ReplyTags: StarCraft 2, Starcraft 2 Review, Starcraft 2 Wings of Liberty, StarCraft II 1919ReplyCrackhead / July 30, 2010 at 12:30 pmSC2 is getting slammed because amateurs like you don?t do your research., Blizzard has said again and again that the two new games will be ?expansions? and ?priced accordingly? so that would NOT MEAN $60 as that price point is for a FULL game (which SC2 is)., There?s loads of misinformation out there, way to go on spreading it.ReplyCristian Masala / July 30, 2010 at 1:41 pmYou are wrong, lets take Warcraft 3 for example, when the ?EXPANSION? came out, it had the same price as the FULL GAME (Reign of Chaos)., I encourage people to buy Starcraft 2, read my review carefully.ReplyDaemonarch / August 2, 2010 at 7:13 amIn any case, the game is far less attractive as we anticipated from the first trailers., I am sure that there will be lots of expansions but like in Warcraft 3, World of warcraft, Diablo 2, we will have to pay for each one of them., Blizzard will expect lots of old Starcraft players to buy this game, but we won?t get tricked to pay this game twice.Final summation Crackhead?..nothin?Replystarcraft2 / July 31, 2010 at 6:00 amThe game play is that all the races are balanced so that each one can counter each other moves through out game play??? each unit as its strengths and weaknesses for the balancingReplydave / August 2, 2010 at 10:09 amPlayed the Beta, enjoyed it, was eager for the game.Then my preorder from gamestop got MAILED to me (wtf), so I snagged a pirated copy of the single player campaign and played through it.I then cancelled my preorder and got a refund.The game isn?t worth $60., If they had included the other 2 branches of the campaign/story arc, it might be., As it stands, it is not.First time I have ever given this advice about a blizzard product ? Don?t buy it.ReplyJacob / August 3, 2010 at 4:01 pmit?s the first time I can actually say I?m disappointed by a blizzard game., The merger with Activision sucks major balls., Blizzard made the BEST games for nearly all of their career, and had become known for it., To flop this hard? it?s just depressing.Hopefully Diablo III doesn?t suck this hard.ReplyRalph / August 18, 2010 at 7:54 pmEnjoyed the game for the first day then I came to the realization that it?s just a better looking Starcraft., Everything seems the same as the first except it doesn?t have the lan play., I won?t be buying another copy any time soon.Replyintrospective / August 20, 2010 at 12:51 amSC sequel is similar like original, there is no major changes., The graphics has been updated a few units added., Still, game is good and enjoyable., It reminds me on good old times.ReplyDavid / August 28, 2010 at 3:15 pmThe storyline is LAME, the cut-scenes are CHEESY and the gameplay is TOTALLY FORGETTABLE., Worst $60 I ever spent., I?ll never buy another Blizzard game after this crap-fest.ReplyChris / September 24, 2010 at 1:27 amWow, such vitriol, I dont understand why people are upset with the game and considering crappy xbox 360 games come out at $60, that doesn?t seem like an outlandish figure to me., That being said, the campaign is only 1/5th of the game, the real meat and potatoes is the multiplayer on battle.net not to mention all those achievements., I have thoroughly enjoyed my SC2 experience, and in the original SC, I would get schooled because I just couldn?t build fast enough, now at least I have somewhat of a chance, my strategy was always sound, I just can?t do those 100 actions a second that the Koreans can do.Considering the crap that gets passed off for video games lately, this is a real game that has a long life ahead of it., Also if you?re saying $60 is too much because it lacks 2 parts of the campaign that they are bringing out in future expansions, that?s really sad, because a game is only part story, hell Fallout 3 just plops you in the desert and says ?Go find stuff?  Borderlands does more or less the same, ?Find the Vault, kill everything?   So the lack of a story making you say a game is bad, is really lame dude.ReplyCF / November 28, 2010 at 11:44 amBecause, Chris, this is a PC game, not an overpriced console game., There is really no excuse for the US$60 pricing., As a matter of fact, it is US$80 here in asia!, and US$ 140 for collector edition., If you don?t call that price gorging, I don?t know what will qualify.As for craps .., then I will take it that you have not played company of heroes, total anniliation, Supreme commander, War hammer I & II or total war series?, By no stretch of imagination can these games be called craps and it only cost a fraction of this game and tonnes more feature that this game offer.As for fallout 3 and borderlands ? please don?t dish other genre simply because you don?t like it., I can do that same for all genre including strategy, which all boils down to just select production building/unit, build unit, send them to fight, upgrade units (if it is available) rinse and repeat, if you want to be nasty about it.Thus final verdict, still not buying, although I was waiting for it for so long.ReplyDameol / October 18, 2010 at 6:20 pmThere is a lot of misinformation in this ?review.?  Blizzard has said over and over and over again that the expansions will be priced as such, and the claim that parts 2 and 3 will be released this year is both incorrect and staggeringly short-sighted., Why are you making things up and reporting them as fact?, ((And no, Frozen Throne cost $35, not $50 like War3))As for the game:  Starcraft 2 is amazing., Blizzard has actually managed to balance the races nearly perfectly., They?ve made a game that is easy to pick up yet difficult (impossible?) to master., The story does seem a bit weak, but it is also only 1/3rd of the total story., Any great story has to spend at least a third, if not a half to two-thirds, of its length manuvering the peices into place.The gameplay is dynamic, hearkening the feel of Starcraft 1 and not repeating the mistake of modern RTS?s of letting the player do everything., Starcraft really makes your attention into a resource.Then, of course, is the matching system, which may be the most advanced in the industry., Incredibly intellegent.Overall, Go to any game store and yuo will have hundreds of examples of worse ways to spend your money than Starcraft 2., Game of the Year, easily.ReplyCF / November 28, 2010 at 11:51 am@DameolIt doesn?t matter., The fact is you don?t get ALL the units for multiplayer and you have to PAY to get these units., And you don?t get the FULL picture until you buy two more expansion ? which even if priced at US$40, is still MORE expensive than a normal game., Don?t you see what blizzard/activision is doing .., they are trying to raise the game price so that they can gorge the player base and most are just lapping it up., If they are allowed to do this, other game publisher will be encourageed to follow (Do not think that EA has reformed, if this pricing becomes a norm, they will follow).And you have put your finger on the point ? Starcraft is JUST about resources and getting perfect build order for specific maps., No other strategy, or sudden come back, or multiple path to victory., Too boring and static for me.I definitely prefer the diverse build order of other games, their more modern features such as zooming, proportionally scaled units (i.e., giant unit is truly gigantic), long build queue, good AI (path finding, seeking cover etc), cover system, destructable terrain and much more., Perhap for you, but this makes for a more exciting game than starcraft?s monotonous game play., Face it, without the script events and story telling, starcraft single player game play is so much more diminished and pales in comparison with other great ? nah even good RTS games.ReplyEric de Jesus / December 14, 2010 at 3:50 pmI had my own share of trial runs with Starcraft 2 at my friend?s desktop.I?d say it?s more balanced today than it was back then with Starcraft 1., You can explore advantages and disadvantages better now.As for the campaign mode, I haven?t tried it yet because I might go to my friend?s house and play the game everyday., That?s just wrong.I?m hoping I can buy an original copy one of these days to get a firsthand experience of what I believe started the LAN strategy games., Click here to cancel reply., Jul 30 2010, 2:00pm CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Digital Trends published a review of the new StarCraft 2, which was launched this week., Quote from the review: "It is difficult to compete with a legend., When StarCraft first came out in 1998, it was well received, and sold around 1.5 million in its first year- a respectable, albeit not spectacular number., Giant Leak Reveals Blizzard's Everything, Blizzard To Gamers: Stop Making Inappropriate <i>StarCraft II</i> Maps, Somewhere along the way, the sci-fi real time strategy game managed to transcend the realm of average and become something different- just ask gamers in Korea, where the StarCraft brand has generated nationally televised competitions, a professional league complete with large cash prizes (and game fixing scandals), and even a television station., The game has gained a cult following, in the most extreme way possible."

Write-Up:
Its been 11 years since the sensation that swept the competitive gaming world by storm was released and finally after much hype and anticipation, our sequel is finally here, and believe me, it absolutely lives up to the speculation!, Released just this past Tuesday for the PC and Mac for $60, Blizzard?s ?Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty? stays true to its roots offering a great story, strong multiplayer, tons of new units and the exact same great game-play we?ve come to expect., Over the past week or so I?ve gotten a lot of negative comments on my ?Starcraft 2? videos from gamers, or their parents, who saw the epic trailer, knew nothing of the original, and expected this to be some futuristic shooter and were seriously pissed off that they were let down or something., Well, let me just show you what all the hype is about., Here?s ?Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty?., Story
First let me start off by saying that if you haven?t played the first ?Starcraft?, you aren?t left in the dust., The game does a great job catching you up on everything that happens, hell, even the installer starts explaining the back-story as the game installs., The story takes place 4 years following ?Brood War? with Jim Raynor wasting away in a bar on the planet Mar?Sara, mourning the loss of his ex would-be-biatch Sarah Kerrian, who as we know has been transformed into the Queen of Blades and is leading the Zerg., Tychus Finley, an ex-con from Raynor?s past shows up with an opportunity to make some money by collecting ancient Xel-Naga artifacts from the Protoss for Mobius, a Terran research corporation., On top of that, self-declared Dominion Emperor Acrturus Mengsk is causing all kinds of trouble as the power has clearly gone to his head., The Zerg have begun attacking colonies all over the universe, and Mengsk blames Raynor for some crazy reason., Anyway, Raynor gets pissed and decides to start a rebellion against the Dominion, and works with Tychus to collect the artifacts for Mobius so that they can raise some money to form their own army to begin the revolution, and at the same time tries to figure out what?s going on with the Queen of Blades, what she is up to and why she is attacking colonies again., Later, Protoss Dark Templar badass Zeratul shows up offering Jim a vision into the past and future providing some insight as to what the hell is really going on and things start to get really interesting., I don?t want to get too spoilery so I?m going to leave it at that, but you?re in for some surprises as you play through this bad boy., To sum it up, Raynor needs to overthrow Mengsk and stop the Zerg., Design
Without a doubt you are going to get a lot of content for your money., I?m not even going to cover the multiplayer portion of the game., If you are looking for info on that, including tips, strategies and the best commentaries on the net, you?re gonna want to check out HD and HuskyStarcraft and click their links below because that?s their specialty and are gonna let you know everything you?d ever want to know., Beyond that, the single player campaign offers you 26 missions that should keep you occupied for at least 15 hours., In addition there is a series of Challenge Missions that really teach you how to get good at ?Starcraft?, including multiplayer techniques like how to hold off a rush., The campaign missions are very well designed, offering a variety of different game-play mechanics beyond simply building a base and army to destroy your enemy?s forces., In fact, some missions even have various outcomes that you?ll have to decide upon that will actually affect how the remainder of the missions will play out for you., There are several difficulty levels and an elegant tutorial system so that even the noobiest of noobs can play and there is an achievement system for each mission, some of which are actually pretty difficult to obtain; you?ll likely have to play through the campaign several times to unlock them all., On top of all of this, you can set up custom games with you and your friends against the AI, or you can play with the extensive ?Starcraft Galaxy Editor? that allows you to create and share seriously awesome levels., I?m not going to cover this in my review, but believe me, those creative independent designers out there are going to create some wonderful content for the Starcraft community., Gameplay
While the basic game-play mechanics from the original ?Starcraft? have not changed a bit, there are some interesting additions that you should be concerned with., First of all, you don?t really have to worry about dealing with upgrades during the missions., Now, there is a hub between the levels that lets you speak with the game?s primary characters to get a lot more of the story and select which of a series of missions you?d like to tackle next, but more importantly, it allows you to upgrade and unlock new troops and research special upgrades via a tech tree., See, as you do missions for Mobius you?ll earn money, which can be spent directly on hiring mercenaries for the missions and upgrading units in the armory., Once you pay for a particular type of mercenary, they are available to hire several times per mission and they are essentially elite units that deal extra damage and have extra health; plus they look way cooler than the standard units., The armory allows you to add uber-powerful upgrades to buildings and units., All of the units from the original ?Starcraft? are in the single player campaign in addition to all of the new units the game provides., It?s too bad that the classic units and all of the uber-upgrades you get from the armory aren?t in the multiplayer, but I understand because it would simply be impossible to keep the game balanced otherwise., The hub also has a mini-game in the form of a shmup that was designed with the Starcraft Galaxy editor which really shows the power of the tool, allowing designers to create brand new games that aren?t of the RTS genre., Finally, as you play the missions you?ll collect Protoss and Zerg technology which can be spent in the hub laboratory to unlock powerful upgrades and new units, one in particular I found necessary to beat the final level of the game., Presentation
There is no doubt that the graphics of the game have seen a significant overhaul over the original, that is, assuming you have a beefy enough computer to run the game on it?s Ultra settings., On top of that, the game is chuck full of beautiful fully rendered cut-scenes that will just blow your mind, and every single one of them, especially those near the end, are freaking epic!, I?ve heard lots of comments from people who state that the graphics look dated and unimpressive but they?re just haters; this is Blizzard?s iconic cartoony art-style and they look wonderful., In addition to the top-down game-play style of the original, you can now zoom in on your units giving you a completely new way to watch the battles as they unfold for you., The soundtrack is top notch both in the cut-scenes as well as the missions and hub., There is even a jukebox in the Hub that plays some pretty hilarious futuristic redneck Terran music., The voice actors for every single role including the individual units in the game are all great as well., ?Starcraft 2? was in development for such a long time and the game?s presentation absolutely displays the time and more importantly care that were put into the detail., Summary
It?s pretty obvious I?m a big fan of Blizzard games so I hope my judgment hasn?t been biased, but really, I don?t care., My reviews are subjective anyway, so make up your mind for yourself based off of what I?ve shown you whether or not this would be a good title for you., ?Starcraft 2? is actually going to be 3 full-length feature titles, one campaign per race., A lot of people complained that they would be paying $180 then for a single game, but really, that?s not the case., The single player campaign of ?Wings of Liberty? alone is well worth the 60 bucks., It is a full-length game and a complete story all on its own, not to mention the extensive multiplayer system, challenge missions and the MASSIVE Galaxy Map Editor with all of the user-created content., It?s too bad that all of the awesome units and sweet upgrades of the single player game aren?t in the multiplayer because it would be really interesting had the tech trees been involved, that way you wouldn?t know what to expect from your opponents simply by knowing their race., Can you imagine having instant supply depots or a machine that slows down zerg units in multiplayer?, Nonetheless, what do you all think?, Are you as excited about ?Starcraft 2? as I am, or are you confused as to why the hell anyone would want to play this?, Leave your questions and comments below!, Logo

here to read our in-depth detailed review of Shokz starcraft 2 guide., Click here to visit Shokz Starcraft 2 Strategy Guide, Starcraft 2 is an excellent single player and multiplayer real-time strategy game., There are a few niggles that stop it being perfect, but a heady combination of nostalgia, evolution and classic gameplay combine to produce one of the best games we've played in years., What's Hot:, It's just like Starcraft 1, the storyline is epic, massive replayability, a few choice improvements in gameplay and graphics, What's Not:, It's just like Starcraft 1, occasional gameplay glitches, why did it take 12 years?, StarCraft 2 is Blizzard's first real-time strategy game since the Frozen Throne expansion of Warcraft III in 2003., It has taken 12 years since the release of the original StarCraft and expansion for the company to complete the long awaited sequel ? and the final product is a game that's quite close to the original in gameplay., No doubt some gamers will be disappointed by the small rewards such a long wait has garnered, and there are occasional in-game frustrations as well, but StarCraft 2 remains an excellent experience., It's equally playable for both amateurs and old-school pro gamers.StarCraft 2, as you'd expect, uses a much newer game engine than the 1997 original., It looks good without being overly flashy ? you can bump up the settings on more powerful PCs for some impressive detail and animation, but older machines can also run a more Spartan level of graphics with ease., AI and pathfinding have also been revamped, but the results aren't always positive; a few times throughout the single player campaign we had units stuck on ramps as a result of navigational glitches, but this is a problem that's relatively easy to address in patches., Single playerStarCraft and the Brood War expansion pack had an exciting and extensive campaign that set (we think, at least) the benchmark for sci-fi RTS games in the years to follow., StarCraft 2 is a sequel in the truest sense ? the story follows on from the events of Brood War, and all the major protagonists are back to play., We've covered the single player story to some extent before in our hands-on preview, and we won't spoil the plot., Suffice to say it's equally as enjoyable, long enough to come to a satisfying conclusion, and short enough that it leaves you wanting the expansion packs to come out now.We also happen to think that the single player campaign scores goals for replayability., Sure, you'll be running through the same missions, but you can complete them in different order and try out new tactics., There are a few levels we're keen to replay and attempt to fully complete ? there's an enticing carrot-dangling achievements system that encourages harder difficulties and unconventional strategies.The single player campaign includes a few evolutionary improvements over the original., Most notable is the implementation of the Cantina, Armory, Laboratory and Bridge environments in between missions that allow players to strengthen units or buildings, hire mercenaries or get some extra back-story., This makes gameplay easier ? the unit upgrades are generally overpowered, and mercenary units are significantly stronger than the units they're based on ? but hardcore players can also ignore these options to avoid altering the game's balance., Having the extra back-story and downtime gives the entire game a slightly less frenetic feel than the original, which is a welcome change., There are also several units in the single player campaign that you won't see in competitive multiplayer., Firebats, Medics and Goliaths are nifty solo inclusions but having them in multiplayer would have skewed the balance of power towards Terran players ? there are similar units available anyway., As you progress through the single player story units are conveniently unlocked as the missions require them, giving players an incentive to keep going.MultiplayerTo be entirely honest, not much at all has changed on the multiplayer side of things., Terran, Zerg and Protoss races are still almost perfectly balanced against each other, and the old-school combination of tactics and ?ber-micro-management is what separates great players from merely good ones., It's relatively easy to play a solid multiplayer match against a casual opponent (or the AI), but it takes plenty of effort and training to keep up in even the lower tiers of online leagues.As you'd expect, strategy is a huge part of the multiplayer phenomenon., If you're only just jumping into the leagues now, you'll likely find yourself outclassed by those with a few weeks' experience under their belts., The slight tweaks that have been made to units and structures lend themselves to some interesting and idiomatic tactics, which can be surprisingly effective if not countered ? you might find a Protoss player dropping a Pylon outside your base which quickly spews forth enemy units thanks to that race's Warp Gate tech upgrade, or a speed-upgraded Zergling rush that occurs before you're able to train a single unit.In general, the multiplayer side of things is massively good fun., Whenever you log on the gameplay is different and there's always scope to try new things ? even if it means you're beaten into a pulp with military efficiency., We don't entirely like the way Battle.net is set up; logging into an account each time you start the game is a hassle, and the lack of a lobby chat room reduces the community vibe., And there's no LAN support!, We know this has been repeated and refuted ad nauseum, but with our rose-tinted glasses on we think the game would have simply been better if the option for a quick offline bash between mates had been included., But overall, StarCraft 2's multiplayer is of the highest quality and offers massive scope for long-term replayability.VerdictStarCraft 2 has improved on the original in a swathe of ways., The graphics are nicer and cleaner, without being overly taxing or unnecessarily slick., The continued storyline is immersive and exciting., Gameplay improvements, especially in the down-time between single player missions and the wide variety of multiplayer strategies, make the experience a well-rounded and enjoyable one that should last the test of time., Don't get us wrong ? there are annoyances, but they take away from the shine of StarCraft 2 only slightly., We enjoyed our time with StarCraft 2, and we're waiting keenly for future expansion packs ? if our experience with this game is any indication, they'll be instant classics as well.Become a fan of GoodGearGuide on FacebookFollow GoodGearGuide on Twitter: @GoodGearGuideStay up to date with the latest reviews., Sign up to

but Blizzard doesn?t care and announced there will never be a LAN mode in Starcraft 2, so do not buy the game hoping you will get one in future updates., No Offline Mode The game does actually have an offline campaign, but it?s only partially offline, because you need to log in to Battle.net to be able to play it., So if you don?t want to connect to the internet or don?t have a connection, you can forget about playing it., The Price Starcraft 2 is one of the most expensive PC games, at $60, being even more expensive than some console games., It may be one of the most expected games around, but the price isn?t justified at all., And when I say this I don?t consider the price you will have to pay for the Protoss and Zerg campaigns., Only Terran campaign Starcraft 2 only comes with the Terran campaign right now and the Protoss and Zerg campaigns will come both separate at standalone games and, of course, you will have to pay for them., If they will both be priced at $60 too, then this makes the game cost a total price of $180, which is a bit expensive, don?t you think ?, DRM When you install the game, you need to either log into your Battle.net account or sign up for one, though this will be useful when you want to play, because you will have to log into your Battle.net account each time you want to play, being it in Single Player mode., No Cross-Region play Blizzard doesn?t offer a simple and free cross-region play, but if you?re desperate to play with either European and American friends, for example, you need to buy 2 games and set up 2 Battle.net accounts., Need I say you will not be able to play with your European and American friends at the same time, if they each have an account on their own region., So if you?re from Europe and want to play with your American friends you either set up your account on Battle.net US and only play with Americans or buy two games and set one on Battle.net US and one on Battle.net EU., No Chat Rooms Starcraft 2 doesn?t feature chat rooms, so say goodbye to talking to your friends in the Starcraft 2 Lobby, though they might include it in future updates., <<<<<Conclusion>>>   Source   Mail me : razathru@d3scene.com, Daniel999  ?

The Right Place For Social Networking, Small World Labs is an enterprise social networking service provider., It allows organizations to build customer engagement communities., Many were impressed with Starcraft II's graphics, which bring state-of-the-art 3D to the franchise, now more than a decade old., "I have to say that the game has definitely passed my expectation of what I would consider a game of 2010 to be," wrote A., Others welcomed the fact that gameplay is similar to the original Starcraft, but faster and with some new twists., "Seasoned and new gamers alike will appreciate the simple yet highly enjoyable gameplay., The factions are well balanced and the units are perfectly valued," wrote NeuroSplicer., "And because the game is richer and deeper, the tension keeps mounting," NeuroSplicer added., "Blizzard has released yet another wonderful product," gushed Leetelite1427., But Starcraft II is also drawing plenty of barbs from users unhappy with Blizzard's technical and pricing decisions., Unlike with the first Starcraft, players cannot go head-to-head over a LAN., Instead, they must play over Blizzard's Internet-based Battlenet service., "LAN play isn't dead, Blizzard., Some of us like having the ultra-low latency of getting together face-to-face with our friends," complained Candace Beauchamp, on Amazon., Others said Blizzard's plan to limit the first version of Starcraft II's campaign play to the Terran race (users must wait for future editions to play as the Zerg or Protoss) is nothing more than a money grab., "So basically it's, 'Here, buy this game three times and then never play it in the same room with your friends," complained a user going by the name Confucius., Still, Starcraft II is bound to be a massive seller despite the grumblings., The basic $59 title, available for Macs and PCs, was the top-seller in Amazon's video game category as of mid-morning Tuesday., A Collector's Edition, which includes a 176-page book of original Starcraft II art and other extras, sells for $99., Now that server virtualization is widespread, can we leverage it to make true business continuity a reality--or at least make recovering from disaster faster and less expensive?, Download our report here (registration required)., Featured Resources

Financial, A decade to separate us: Ars reviews StarCraft 2, Gamers have expectations for StarCraft 2 that will be impossible to meet., Players have waited a decade for a sequel to what is widely considered to be one of the best real-time strategy games of all time, and one of the world's most-played PC games, period., Blizzard certainly isn't afraid to make bold choices: LAN gaming is out, the title is being split into three releases, and the game is launching alongside a reboot of the popular Battle.net service that stretches across all of Blizzard's properties., We've been playing StarCraft 2 since Monday, and the game is good., It's very good., It's also classical in how it treats its units and the gameplay; those who were never impressed with the original game aren't going to be convinced by this sequel., But if you wanted more StarCraft, with different units, adjusted strategy, and a fully fleshed-out single-player game, then this is going to hit your life like a bomb., Say goodbye to your other hobbies, buy your wife some flowers, and get your kids some new toys., It may be time to take a few days off work., StarCraft 2 is finally here, and it threatens to swallow us whole., PC, OS X


Installation begins with a graphical recap of the story of StarCraft up to this point., You'll be asked to either log into Battle.net or create an account, and you'll be introduced to the new social hub of your Blizzard gaming., You can add friends via Facebook, add Real ID friends if you don't mind sharing your real name, take a look around the beginner's guide to get a feel for the game, play some tutorials..., if you don't quite know what's going on, Blizzard throws a number of things at you to read or watch in order to get you up to speed., The whole setup is rather slick, with in-game news reports, write-ups of new maps, and FAQs to get you started playing on the official Leagues or Ladders., Battle.net can be a rather intimidating place, but there is plenty of content here to explain what exactly is going on so you'll be familiar with the various aspects of the service before you begin to play., If you're new to the series or just want to brush up on your skills, playable tutorials are ready to get you going., It's friendly, it's inviting, and it's a good point of entry into the world of StarCraft 2., While you'll only play as Terran and Protoss during the single-player campaign, there is a series of Challenge Missions included to help you learn all three races., Each race gets a Basic, Advanced, and Expert challenge, and these will help you learn advanced strategy, introduce you to higher-level play, and teach you about the use of the different units., While you don't need to play these to have a good time, they are an excellent touch for beginner or novice players, and are a welcome addition to the single-player content., Now, let's discuss the campaign., Not all who wander are lost..., some of us are drunk 

The single-player game now has a hub area; you can move around Raynor's ship and explore the Lab, the Bridge, the Cantina, and the Armory., In the Cantina, you can play a 2D shooter that shows what's possible with the game's editor., The jukebox is filled with songs from the fictional world, as well as covers of recognizable hits., You can gain achievements by exploring your ship and talking to your friends and cohorts., StarCraft was a single-player game where the story was explained by talking heads; the sequel features impressive hub areas filled with detail, conversation, and color., StarCraft 2


Early in the game, you're faced with a mission where your forces must protect convoys making the trek to an extraction point by slowly trundling down a road beset with Zerg., This should be terrible?no one likes escort missions?but the colonists' vehicles can fight back to a limited degree., You can send mobile troops to escort them, or you can set up bunkers to simply own the road., If you want to get moving on tech advances, then you can explore the surrounding countryside for three Zerg artifacts that give you upgrade points., The road is long and straight, and the Zerg throw increasingly powerful enemies at you?it's a thrilling tactical challenge., The mission should be terrible according to conventional wisdom, but you can tell the mission was playtested into the ground, and the result is a challenge, not a chore., Other levels introduce a night and day mechanic with different enemies, a rush to grab a set amount of minerals to bribe a mercenary, or stealing walking super weapons from the Dominion's forces., Without needing to balance these units and ideas for multiplayer, the designers at Blizzard went crazy with single-player missions, and it's wonderful to play the game and realize you have no clue what you're in for from one mission to the next., This is StarCraft; large masses of units are possible, In one mission you're laying waste to a series of trains that travel along a predetermined track, and as you attack, the enemy sends out a wave of very powerful units that patrol the tracks., It's not hard to avoid their patrols and carry out the mission, but if you take them on and win you'll gain an achievement., Sure, that's mostly bragging rights, but watching the crowd of units march around the map made me angry., Hide from them?, This little bit of drama doesn't change the story, but it gives the mission an extra kick, and it gives you another reason to go in and try harder., I ended up paying for a few waves of mercenaries back in my base and successfully taking them down with a little help from my marauders., Because this is my land, bitch., The mission variety is wonderful, and you'll be using your units in all sorts of fun ways throughout the game, but you'll never forget what game you're playing., This is StarCraft, where strategy and resource management are much more important than tactics., Your soldiers don't have any sort of cover system, there is no way to arrange them in any formation, and the best you can hope for in this regard is the advantage given to units with higher ground., Battles between units are often rock-scissors-paper affairs with the winner decided based on number of units or strength/weakness against attacking units., You'll know how most engagements are going to end before a shot is fired., The missions offer opportunities to earn "research points" that unlock new units or powers, Depending on how much of a completist you are, the single-player campaign can be finished in as little as 15 hours or as much as..., well, the sky is the limit., The higher difficulty levels are tough, and each mission can introduce multiple goals and different challenges that must be met to earn all the achievements., If you're interested in the story and don't want a challenge, anyone can cruise through Casual difficulty, but if you want to test your mettle you can jack it up to Brutal., in no way replicates what you'll experience against other human players, but the higher the difficulty the more you'll need to worry about speed, efficiency, and unit selection., Also, while we won't spoil anything, the campaign has a definite ending., It's not a cliffhanger., Read more stories, Newer Story >, Humble Bundle 2 is live: 5 great games, no DRM, pay what you want, Click here to view the 294 comments on this story, Is this your domain?Add hosting, email and more., Want to buy this domain?, Our Domain Buy Service can help you get it., ?

This is going to be your home for the next decade or so if you're a Blizzard fan, and the good news is that this thing is slamming., The interface is simple to use, the social aspects tie into the game, and everything feels zippy and smooth., When you chat with a friend, the window can be moved anywhere on screen; you can check your friend's profiles to see their win-loss record and recent games, and everything is placed exactly where it needs to be., If you're lucky enough to have wrangled a beta invite, spend some time just getting used to the new digs., Blizzard has put together something very special., Jack your resolution

There is nothing like running a real-time strategy game at 1920 by 1200., Now, upping your resolution simply adds sharpness to the screen, it doesn't look like you'll be able to see more of the map with a big screen at higher resolutions., I'm playing on a 24.5" monitor and at first it was frustrating to see how zoomed in the view was, but we have to be fair for competitive reasons., Still, it looks nice., You can adjust the texture quality and the reflections, and the unit portraits can be in 3D or 2D., You can adjust the sounds so that the interface noises can't be heard over the ambient sounds or the sound effects., You can set your voice chat to voice-activated or push-to-talk, and your mouse options are completely configurable., Whether you have a high end or mid-range system, you'll be able to get this game running decently, and the list of adjustments and possible tweaks is impressive., This kind of customization should be standard for PC titles, but sadly, it's not., Seeing a game that's clearly built from the ground up for PC gamers, with all that entails, is refreshing., Learn from your enemies

Your matches are saved as replays in Battle.net, so you can go back and take notes on exactly what went right and what went wrong., You can watch the game from your perspective or from your enemy's, and you can pause, fast-forward and rewind., It's all very easy to use., The ability to zoom into the fight also allows you to enjoy all the eye-candy without worrying about messing up your game., After losing, which is happening frequently to me right now, it's great to go back and see exactly what my opponents did., How quickly did they explore?, Where did they send scouts?, What's their build order?, Knowledge is going to be viral in StarCraft 2, with every move you make becoming an open book after each match., This may annoy those who like to keep their strategies secret, but for those of us who aren't as skilled at real-time strategy games, every match is going to be like going to school., Your replays can be accessed by hitting the camera icon in the upper right portion of the screen, and they're arranged by type of game or just in chronological order., You can save or delete them at will, or organize them into folders., It's simple, and makes learning the game a snap., Read more stories, Newer Story >, Humble Bundle 2 is live: 5 great games, no DRM, pay what you want, Click here to view the 106 comments on this story, HomeElectronics & GadgetsInternet Games

Blizzard Enertainment, Review Date: August 21 2010 Publisher: Blizzard Enertainment Developer: Blizzard Enertainment ESRB Rating: Teen Genre: Real-time Strategy Game Platforms: Windows, MacIt has been many years since Blizzard released an RTS game and more than a decade since the original StarCraft came out, but the long wait for StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty is finally over., Sequels can be risky because some people want unique and innovative changes, while others want the game to stay close to its roots, which, after all, bought about the franchise's popularity in the first place., StarCraft 2 manages to walk a fine line between the old and the new that is likely to go over well with both long-time fans and those that are just introducing themselves to the IP., Although the single-player campaign will be broken into three parts, one for each race, the multiplayer component of Wings of Liberty is complete., As in the original, you play as either Terran, Protoss, or Zerg, three races that are dramatically different from one another, both in how they look and how they play.Blizzard EntertainmentTerran Featured in the single-player campaign in Wings of Liberty, the Terran are technologically advanced human descendants., Terrans have fewer limitations on building spots than the other races, because Protoss can only build near pylons and Zerg need creep to build on., Terran supply depots make handy walls and can be lowered to allow friendly troops through., Although they still have Battlecruisers, Ghosts, and Marines, Terrans have several new units in StarCraft 2., Firebats are replaced by Marauders, which have an attack that slows the enemy and does high damage to armored units., The Banshee is a new air unit that can only attack ground targets, and the Thor is a large mechanical walker that makes quite an impression on the battlefield.Protoss The Protoss are an advanced alien race with powerful psionic abilities., When playing Protoss you have to plan your construction around pylons, which are needed to increase your unit count., Probes, the Protoss worker unit, summon buildings into position, so they fill requests quickly compared to Terran SCVs., Protoss structures gradually heal themselves, but there is no way to repair or heal Protoss units., Along with their customary Zealots and Templars, Protoss now has the Colossus, a tall spider-like vehicle armed with lasers that sweep through enemy targets., They've also been granted the Mothership, a costly flying fortress that deals out considerable damage and cloaks friendly units in its proximity., Zerg Least like the other races are the Zerg, an alien insectoid species that relies on the strength of numbers to overwhelm the enemy., Most of the Zerg units, including their worker Drones, begin as Larva that spawn from the hatchery., Instead of requistioning Drones directly from the hatchery akin to the other factions, Zerg players need to turn a Larva into Drones, which are then sacrificed when a structure is created.Blizzard EntertainmentZerglings, Mutalisks, and Hydralisks are among the units that remain from the original., New to the field are Roaches, suicidal Banelings, and Overseers, which are like Overlords with different abilities, such as detection., The Zerg are one of the most unique races ever seen in an RTS game, and it takes a while to adjust to the unusual play style they require., There are a lot of small things Zerg players constantly need to attend to., Both their bases and their units seems to demand more management than the other factions, and they have no structure that makes an effective wall., I'd wager that Zerg are at a slight disadvantage right now, but there is likely to be more balance tweaks in upcoming patches., Maps and Match Types

There is an incredibly large selection of 52 multiplayer maps that ship with StarCraft 2, typically designed with a certain amount of symetry to ensure that neither side starts with a big advantage., They aren't all available on every Ladder because they have different numbers of starting positions, ranging from 2 to 8., User ReviewsWrite a reviewBe the first to write a review

You can't just steal text for your review., You didn't even offer a real opinion on the game anyway., Start New Thread | Reply | Reply Quoting This Message | Reviews, After a good year of thinking Blizzard were never going to release another RTS due to their MMO cup "running over" I have found a statement that they are working on a NEW starcraft RTS for the PC with a Q1 2008 release., This is good news for me as I was a fan of the original Warcraft and Star craft titles., I found them infinitely more fun than spending hours farming and mining virtual fields and mines in a game you could played with 2 fingers., The warcraft RTS and Starcraft series has got to the same point now as the C&C series where it is really just a case of making everything a bit prettier, adding a few new units and release a game with ne levels and this title will be no exception., There ARE a few new units and they have made the 3D engine slightly better but to be honest, there are no real shocks in store., StarCraft II continues the epic saga of the Protoss, Terran, and Zerg., These three distinct and powerful races will clash once again in the fast-paced real-time strategy sequel to the legendary original, StarCraft., They have made a few changes to the balance of the teams as lets face it, you had no chance of winning unless you were Protoss in the old game., This lead to some less than riviting multiplayer matches., Legions of veteran, upgraded, and brand-new unit types will be at your disposal but it doesn't look, from preliminary reports, that they have worked round the "grunt rush" issues of the first game., This was the worst game for "grunt rushes I have ever come across., Again, Battlenet will allow for online play and they have made a few tweaks to make the server loadings smoother., Basically this game will be a curly whirly., Over they years they have reduced the sugar, reduced the size and changed the recipe for the chocolate but it is still just the same old Curly whirly., Start New Thread | Reply | Reply Quoting This Message | Reviews, You've come to the best place if you're looking for Starcraft 2 reviews for PC Games., You'll find a great user-submitted Starcraft 2 review right here and also have the ability to give your own Starcraft 2 opinions or Starcraft 2 ratings simply by getting involved., Also, by joining in you'll be in with an amazing chance to win free games and prizes with our great competiton., Our forums are safe, and moderated by several people on a daily basis., You may wish to read the Freeola Chat Safety Tips., At least they?re not trying the APB way?, Kirrus says: July 23, 2010 at 2:21 pm, Elyas says: July 23, 2010 at 2:22 pm, @Elyas
?a?pply a blessed unicorn horn, you?ll feel better., disperse says: July 23, 2010 at 3:35 pm, Askaris says: July 23, 2010 at 2:24 pm, I had a ham, cheese, tomato and mayonnaise sandwich from the deli in town., You know, the new one opposite where Smith?s used to be., Yes, they do do sandwiches, they?re on your right just as you walk in., Next to the cakes, yeah., It was delicious., robrob says: July 23, 2010 at 2:25 pm, Well, this isn?t really surprising, given the state of the servers at the end of the beta., They really do need that one week to get things up and running properly at launch., pkt-zer0 says: July 23, 2010 at 2:25 pm, I haven?t played in months., Quintin Smith says: July 23, 2010 at 2:28 pm, Quinns, can you stay on topic please?, robrob says: July 23, 2010 at 2:29 pm, I blame the steam influx for these off-topic comments., Rinox says: July 23, 2010 at 2:52 pm, Quintin Smith says: July 23, 2010 at 3:02 pm, Dunno what this chap is talking about., Servers were just fine for me a day before the beta closed., Daniel Klein says: July 23, 2010 at 3:14 pm, There have never been any problems with the servers ever., Definitely not blizzard says: July 23, 2010 at 3:19 pm, Last patch broke things a bit., No custom maps, the game randomly failing to authenticate when launching maps from the editor, number of remaining placement matches going into the negatives., Things were perfectly fine previously, though., pkt-zer0 says: July 23, 2010 at 3:40 pm, There was a fair bit of wobbliness in the front end all the way through beta., But? it?s a beta, and they did keep moving the interface around and adding features ? so fair enough., randomnine says: July 23, 2010 at 4:18 pm, ?There have never been any problems with the servers ever.?
You clearly don?t remember Patch 13 weekend., Psychopomp says: July 23, 2010 at 11:12 pm, I think you clearly missed the name of the poster :), Thermal Ions says: July 24, 2010 at 5:44 am, Ham and cheese baguette and 3 pints of Guinness., Dave says: July 23, 2010 at 2:26 pm, You win at lunch., Auspex says: July 23, 2010 at 2:50 pm, jeremypeel says: July 23, 2010 at 3:05 pm, That?s excessive!, Unless, of course, you?re actually in Ireland., I had a cheap pizza and no Guinness whatsoever, but if that counts I can still feel the effects of last night?s pints., And since we?re on the topic, if you?re looking for a good rock bar in Dublin, Bruxelles is what I recommend., Unless you have to work the next day., Daniel Klein says: July 23, 2010 at 3:12 pm, Bruxelles do a good pint of guinness too., Jerricho says: July 23, 2010 at 3:14 pm, But yesterday was Beamish day., Felt like something spicier., Daniel Klein says: July 23, 2010 at 3:15 pm, THREE pints?, I just love guinness, actually it?s my favourite kind of stout., But after three pints I?d feel doozy., And how do you hold that much liquid?, Arnulf says: July 23, 2010 at 4:09 pm, you don?t, that teh trick, ChaK_ says: July 24, 2010 at 10:25 am, I woke up at 11 am and had a Tomato-Mozarella-Baguette for breakfast., Dave says: July 23, 2010 at 2:26 pm, They don?t want to get mostly negative reviews., That?s reasonable., Saiko Kila says: July 23, 2010 at 2:27 pm, That?s the usual reason to forbid reviews or not sending review copies before launch., Carra says: July 23, 2010 at 2:51 pm, if this game boots up it?s getting 10s., negativedge says: July 23, 2010 at 10:45 pm, @ Saiko Kila
Yes, clearly that is what they are afraid of?, Azradesh says: July 24, 2010 at 3:36 pm, haven?t had any yet., Sobric says: July 23, 2010 at 2:28 pm, I haven?t eaten anything since yesterday., I blame the heat wave., pierec says: July 23, 2010 at 5:46 pm, Maybe have something to hide? what is weird again, because lot of people have already played the game with the betas, so any bad info I can imagine, is already public., The release day will be (of course) horrible, servers will crash, with too much demands., Maybe journalist can get some training in spiritist, and start posting news about the past, and doing interviews to dead celebrities., What is the point of journalist, wen you are the last ones to party?, Is basically, a dick move, maybe to sell a few more box, but nothing important anyway, maybe even will sell a bit less box., Do SC2 have unlockables?, Tei says: July 23, 2010 at 2:29 pm, Not all that surprising, either you have preordered it ages ago, or you don?t care., Same way MW2 and WoW expansions didn?t really need reviews., I can see the reviews already: Still the same old starcraft, single player is pretty, missed opportunity for innovation, punishing multiplayer, polished to mirror shine, etc., I don?t care, it?s the best RTS out there and that?s all  need to know., Zaphid says: July 23, 2010 at 2:30 pm, Chocolate spread sandwiches., wait wat., Its only the best if you like rushing tactics, if not it won?t be., Skinlo says: July 23, 2010 at 2:35 pm, @Skinlo: There are novice variants of the maps that make rushes impossible., pkt-zer0 says: July 23, 2010 at 3:41 pm, As does knowing how to play, Dolphan says: July 23, 2010 at 5:01 pm, No ?missed opportunity for innovation? here., The kind of ?innovation? that most RTS devs are doing right now would kill the game., Changing the fundamental basics of the game would be a missed opportunity to make a solid sequel to the most popular RTS ever., Janxer says: July 23, 2010 at 5:24 pm, The innovation is the fact you?re so busy at any given point in time after the first ten seconds you never actually get to look at the game which is quite pretty but it really doesn?t matter if you?re so busy herding Drones to mine new things that you don?t get to look at the pretty graphics so you might as well turn those off and because the learning curve is so steep you need a climbing kit to learn how to play better than an angry Zergling swarm you might as well turn the game off and save yourself some time., Still, the custom maps should be fun., DJ Phantoon says: July 23, 2010 at 10:51 pm, Oh no, a game forces you to stay constantly involved in whats going on., Psychopomp says: July 23, 2010 at 11:14 pm, Right, totally miss my point for a smarmy remark., It?s hard to get into, and harder to care enough to get good at., Which makes it a bit like Defense of the Ancients for Warcraft 3 in the way that it was inaccessible enough to not be worth it., You have to be doing twenty different things at any sort of time which might be fine for you but if I?m going to have tactics I want TACTICS not micromanaging every single battle I have so I can forget about my one Ghost with his EMP, or my one Strider thing that I am currently too busy to tell to flank., Making a game hard to play isn?t good game design!, Hard to master is completely acceptable but if the only people I have the slightest chance of doing well against are other people who also never really play RTSes then is it my fault that I?m dumb or the game?s fault for being so damn complicated?, Also, the game is really pretty but I never have any time to look at it if I want to win., The constant micromanagement is already enough but god help you if you stop to look at the shiny things because losing ten seconds of not building another marine is disastrous., Sure I can hotkey things again, that?s another thing to remember to do., But since you ignored my earlier point with mocking schoolyard laughter I?m going to assume you?re going to do more of the same except while calling me exotic names like a ?berk? so I don?t know why I even bothered., DJ Phantoon says: July 24, 2010 at 6:05 am, @DJ Phantoon: Your problem doesn?t seem to be that the game is hard to get into, but that you don?t even understand what the game is., Constant micromanagement of units isn?t a concern at lower skill levels., Time and attention is indeed a limited resource you have to manage, but that?s why the game is a real-time strategy game., Wanting to just enjoy looking at the scenery is missing the point of not only this game, but competitive games in general., Players completely new to the game wouldn?t even be playing 1v1 matches, co-op games against the AI and 2v2 are more likely choices., pkt-zer0 says: July 24, 2010 at 9:35 am, [...] is it my fault that I?m dumb?, I blame the parents and the school system., Raum says: July 24, 2010 at 8:07 pm, To get back on topic, I?m actually holding out till the reviews come out before I decide completely., Oh and I have to agree with Phantoon., I was in the beta and I really noticed how they made it more, not less finicky., Which is why I?m waiting for the reviews to come out., There are ways to design RTSs that doesn?t involve having to twitch through the game at breakneck pace., kromagg says: July 25, 2010 at 4:00 pm, AndrewC says: July 23, 2010 at 2:32 pm, Chicken and rice is fine but there?s no need to call him a jerk just for asking!, Jesterrr says: July 23, 2010 at 2:43 pm, I haven?t even had any lunch., Jim Rossignol says: July 23, 2010 at 2:34 pm, Cunzy1 1 says: July 23, 2010 at 3:24 pm, head and shoulders, toothpaste, and sh*t? biiiiig pieces of sh*t?, Crandle says: July 23, 2010 at 2:36 pm, Wait, how can Blizzard do this?, How can they stop people from writing up their opinions of the game?, FhnuZoag says: July 23, 2010 at 2:37 pm, They?re not., However, it?s hard to review a game you can?t play yet, which is where trying to review it before the release date becomes difficult if whatever development company/publisher involved isn?t distributing review copies., bleeters says: July 23, 2010 at 2:41 pm, you can write you reviews but the reviewer might have signed a non disclosure agreement (meaning they have to wait until Blizzard says so) or in the other case they risk Act-Blizz blacklisting them and not inviting their sites/magazines into the advanced show/release party/e3 lookalike for their next game, JKjoker says: July 23, 2010 at 3:41 pm, The activation servers are not up yet, the game doesn?t launch., pkt-zer0 says: July 23, 2010 at 3:42 pm, I cobbled together an end-of-the-week meal, consisting of whatever?s left over between two slices of bread., bleeters says: July 23, 2010 at 2:38 pm, Hurrah for Quinns? triumphant return., wellsaidted says: July 23, 2010 at 2:39 pm, Three chocolate chip buns., mrpier says: July 23, 2010 at 2:40 pm, Fideua, Valencia style (which in most parts of Spain means paella but with thick short noodles instead of rice) which was actually quite tasty, and some lamb chop., Risingson says: July 23, 2010 at 2:41 pm, I?m jealous, I?ve not had a decent fideu? since I left to live in Holland, too long ago., I miss mum?s food?
Anyway, back to business and serious matters:
Roast Chicken, green beans and an apple, Joe Duck says: July 23, 2010 at 3:40 pm, Jubaal says: July 23, 2010 at 2:41 pm, Starcraft 2 is no where near as fun as Dawn of War: Dark Crusade., bit_crusherrr says: July 23, 2010 at 2:42 pm, @ Dave
I?m jealous of your Guinness drinking., I?m still at work but there is a pub dangerously close by., An Italian Pizza Wrap from Pret followed by a Cadbury?s Wispa., Jerricho says: July 23, 2010 at 2:42 pm, Cheese and Tomato Panini., It was delicious., Anyway, I can?t see this whole review embargo thing harming the game., Anyone waiting for the reviews probably isn?t the kind of Diehard Fan Blizzard is targeting., Personally, as someone who never played the original game, I watched the recent Story/Recap trailer and felt nothing., Starcraft 2 isn?t being made for me in the same way that the World of Warcraft expansions aren?t made for me as a non WOW player., Krimson says: July 23, 2010 at 2:45 pm, Eating prawn cocktail crisps RIGHT NOW, ChaosSmurf says: July 23, 2010 at 2:45 pm, I?m not the slightest bit interested in this or Diablo 3., I honestly don?t know why, because I should be., Games have become so convoluted (sign up for this and that, enter codes for stuff, blah fucking blah), that I?m more interested in seeing what dickery they have come up with this time., Not Blizzard specifially, mind you, but the industry in general., Zogtee says: July 23, 2010 at 2:48 pm, Just regrets., Curvespace says: July 23, 2010 at 2:48 pm, Curvespace says: July 23, 2010 at 2:49 pm, That you didn?t buy any food?, bleeters says: July 23, 2010 at 2:51 pm, Also, screw you for luring me into this comment thread by mentioning food in the tags., I don?t care for Sc2.., Batolemaeus says: July 23, 2010 at 2:48 pm, Auspex says: July 23, 2010 at 2:48 pm, Jerricho says: July 23, 2010 at 3:15 pm, Not much, yet, considering it?s 9:00 AM where I live., dragon_hunter21 says: July 23, 2010 at 2:50 pm, I haven?t even had breakfast yet :(
/goes looking for nom, TeeJay says: July 23, 2010 at 2:50 pm, It?s just piracy measures, guys., Game will be cracked 4 hours after a working copy is played by a human being ? they just want the original to be available in stores before the cracked version., I support., klei says: July 23, 2010 at 2:51 pm, Macaroni and scrambled egg, followed by a side order of gut problems., Frosty says: July 23, 2010 at 2:51 pm, clive dunn says: July 23, 2010 at 2:52 pm, It?s 8 minutes to o? seven hundred here, and I?ve yet to have breakfast much less lunch., yangman says: July 23, 2010 at 2:54 pm, Horse steak and fries + a glass of wine and a beer  at the company restaurant., Rinox says: July 23, 2010 at 2:54 pm, Let me guess ? you?re in France?, TeeJay says: July 23, 2010 at 4:38 pm, let me tell you a little something about myself., My father was a relentlessly self-improving Boulanger owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery., My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet., My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark., Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament., My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons., In the spring we?d make meat helmets., When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really., At the age of 12 I received my first scribe., At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles., There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it?s breathtaking, I suggest you try it., Rinox says: July 23, 2010 at 9:51 pm, Oats porridge, tomato, hard coiled egg, pickle and tea., Coldwave says: July 23, 2010 at 2:55 pm, Crandle says: July 23, 2010 at 2:58 pm, Give it a couple of hours., AndrewC says: July 23, 2010 at 3:00 pm, Ironic Man says: July 24, 2010 at 2:39 am, It was nice, but it was nothing compared to st-ohfuckit., Is it shit then, what?s the deal?, Nallen says: July 23, 2010 at 2:55 pm, Is anyone taking orders?, And could I see the wine list?, Novotny says: July 23, 2010 at 2:56 pm, Ian says: July 23, 2010 at 2:56 pm, WTF are you talking about RPS?, Its only 8 AM where I am at!, Evernight says: July 23, 2010 at 2:57 pm, We are from the future, TeeJay says: July 23, 2010 at 4:43 pm, Sausage, Egg and Bacon was for what i had for my lunch oh and a coffee, LieutLaww says: July 23, 2010 at 2:58 pm, The servers were fine at the end of beta, BurntSuga says: July 23, 2010 at 3:01 pm, My guess is it is because they care deeply about the story they are telling in single player, and they want to limit the chances of spoilers., After all, the MP is well understood by now., I essentially agree with them on this decision., If SC2 gets less than a 9.5 I will be amazed, so it?s not a question of will the game be good, but rather can we preserve its surprises as long as possible., 7 Seas says: July 23, 2010 at 3:02 pm, so you are convinced a game that nobody has played will get 9.5?, That really is the ultimate goal of large games publishers hype departments., How do I eprsuade people that Gratuitous Space Battles 2 will get 9.5 or more, without letting anyone play it., This is a neat trick, to put it mildly?, cliffski says: July 23, 2010 at 3:17 pm, It?s not completely unreasonable to say, as the multiplayer beta has been around for months and lots of people have played it., The multiplayer is probably good enough on its own merit to earn at least an 8/10 or so., Garg says: July 23, 2010 at 3:42 pm, The multiplayer on Supreme Commander  was good, the single was a bit shite though and it wasn?t  a 95% minimum game., The Cool-Aid, you are drinking it., Nallen says: July 23, 2010 at 3:51 pm, Uhm says: July 23, 2010 at 5:22 pm, @cliffski
Spend several decades making highly rated and successful games., It?s that simple., Sonic Goo says: July 23, 2010 at 8:33 pm, @cliffski : spending monstrous amounts of money of cliched trailers that appeal to the lowest common denominator., http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_E83GfWM-A
And no, i am not bitter ., TheHumanBlur says: July 23, 2010 at 10:26 pm, ?How do I eprsuade people that Gratuitous Space Battles 2 will get 9.5 or more, without letting anyone play it.?
Precede it with an RTS that remains at the top of the genre for 10 years and becomes the national pastime of South Korea., Whilst you?re twiddling your thumbs waiting for that to run its course, develop the most successful video game of all time and have it stay at the top of the entire industry for 5 years straight., Come back after that and I?ll give you the benefit of the doubt with GSB 2., Jimbo says: July 23, 2010 at 11:24 pm, Not sure I need to reiterate what the others said, but since I respect your development I?ll answer your question in the same way., Since 1995 Blizzard has made the following games:
Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness	1995	fantasy real-time strategy game
Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal	1996	expansion pack
Diablo	1997	Hack?N Slash
StarCraft	1998	science fiction real-time strategy game
StarCraft: Brood War	1998	expansion pack
Warcraft II: Battle.net Edition	1999	fantasy real-time strategy game
Diablo II	2000	Hack?N Slash
Diablo II: Lord of Destruction	2001	expansion pack
Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos	2002	fantasy real-time strategy game
Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne	2003	expansion pack
World of Warcraft	2004	MMORPG set in the Warcraft universe., World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade	2007	expansion pack
World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King	2008	expansion pack
Every single one of those games is either a critical lauded, beloved new entry to a genre, or an expansion pack to such a game., They have succeeded in what is arguably the most difficult business in gaming, the MMO., Their games are a national obsession in parts of the world., Their games are played and purchased in volume 12 years their release., Diablo essentially created the action-rpg genre, and has yet to be surpassed, despite not having a serious release in 9 years., They take their time, and get it right., Surely, you can appreciate that., While I am a notorious anti-hype ranter, in blizzard?s case the only thing they have to do to generate hype is say ?we are releasing a new game?., An extensive track record of proven quality, longevity, and attention to detail earns you the expectation of your fans that you will release nothing but peerless superb games., 7 Seas says: July 24, 2010 at 10:45 am, TheMoo says: July 23, 2010 at 3:03 pm, I can -kind of- understand the motive here., The battlenet feature has a much-touted matchmaking system that (I imagine) requires a critical mass of players to function well., I imagine there are, of course, other motives in play in restricting reviews (!Hah!, Everywhere? & all that)
But surely there are loads of games reviewers out there?, All gonna be playing the game quite a bit?, If anyone?s happy to comment ? in reviewing experience, are matchmaking features often rendered useless / unreviewable by low pre-launch player numbers?, Cooper says: July 23, 2010 at 3:06 pm, @cooper: Reviewers won?t have access to the full game until the game launches on the 27th, and the beta was multiplayer only, so any review made based on that would have to ignore the very promising (and very different from multiplayer) single player campaign, as well as other features like the challenge maps., Starcraft may be famed by its multiplayer, but it also had an amazingly strong single player., Reviewing the game without reviewing single player wouldn?t only be very poor journalism, it would also be making the series a disservice., Xocrates says: July 23, 2010 at 4:33 pm, That?s a circular argument, though., Reviewers can?t review it until they get access, and who controls when they get access?, raskolnik says: July 23, 2010 at 9:54 pm, I had a BLT but had no tomatoes so just a BL and it was technically my breakfast aswell as lunch., Frankle says: July 23, 2010 at 3:06 pm, Ian says: July 23, 2010 at 3:30 pm, Leftover gratin dauphinois made with gruy?re., Nick says: July 23, 2010 at 3:09 pm, The service here is terrible!, Just as well I have 5 loaves and a couple of fish here., I?ll try to make it go round everyone, Novotny says: July 23, 2010 at 3:12 pm, Chicken and Peri-Peri Sanvich., Blizzard are just being prissy, they know it?s going to get rave reviews everywhere., Unless their development team have spent the last 3-4 years playing tiddlywinks of course., mondomau says: July 23, 2010 at 3:13 pm, - salami sandwich

	It?s too early to provide an estimate of the StarCraft2 release date., As 
	with all Blizzard games, we will take as much time as needed to ensure 
	StarCraft 2 is as fun, balanced, and polished as possible., ..but here's the most common questions you might be interested in., StarCraft II is the ultimate competitive real-time strategy game, and the 
	sequel to the hit original, StarCraft., The game will include three 
	completely distinct and balanced races, the Protoss, Terran, and Zerg, 
	which have been overhauled and re-imagined with a number of new units for 
	each, as well as new tricks for some of the classic units that are 
	returning., This is a short writing about Starcraft 2 from Blizzard games., They are working hard with this one, so you can be sure Blizzard games 
	delivers a great RTS experience with Starcraft II., Recently Asked questions, also from Blizzard (link)
	When is the game coming out?, At this point, it's too early to provide an initial estimate on the release 
	date., As with all Blizzard games, we will take as much time as needed to 
	ensure the game is as fun, balanced, and polished as possible., How will StarCraft II be different from StarCraft?, StarCraft II will run on a vibrant new 3D-graphics engine that will be 
	capable of rendering beautiful landscapes as well as massive individual 
	units and army sizes., We're also introducing a number of distinct new units to the Protoss, 
	Terran, and Zerg, and even some of the familiar units that return in 
	StarCraft II will have new tricks up their sleeves, which will give the game 
	its own unique flavor., In addition, Battle.net will be overhauled with some new and exciting 
	features to enhance online play and competition, while the campaign will 
	also offer some unique aspects for players who enjoy single-player content., We'll have more details on all these aspects in the months to come., Will there be both single-player and multiplayer components?, Yes, StarCraft II will include a unique single-player campaign, as well as 
	multiplayer capability over Battle.net., We'll provide more detail on both of 
	these aspects a little further along in the development process., What will StarCraft II's story line be?, Will any of the characters from the original StarCraft make an appearance in 
	StarCraft II?, It's a little too early to get into details on the story., Once 
	we're able to discuss the single-player campaign in detail, we'll also share 
	some exciting information about the story line for the game., How many cinematic cut-scenes will be included?, We know that StarCraft II players will expect to see some Blizzard-quality 
	cinematic content in the game, and we have definite plans to include 
	multiple cinematics, starting with a cinematic intro., We'll provide further 
	confirmation once final determinations have been made., In StarCraft II, players will see the return of the Protoss, Terran, and 
	Zerg races., Our goal is to ensure that all the factions in the game play 
	even more distinctly from one another than in the original StarCraft, while 
	still maintaining the fine balance that helped make StarCraft such a 
	classic., We're also introducing a number of new units to each race, as well 
	as modifying some of the familiar units returning in StarCraft II., With 
	these design refinements and the new features we have planned for the 
	single-player and multiplayer elements of the game, StarCraft II will offer 
	a next-generation StarCraft experience., StarCraft II has some big shoes to fill - is there added pressure in 
	developing a follow-up to one of the most beloved games of all time?, We recognize that the bar is set pretty high, but this type of pressure is 
	not new to us., Warcraft III had to follow in the footsteps of Warcraft II, 
	and Diablo II had to follow the original Diablo., Creating a StarCraft game 
	that's bigger and better than the original is definitely a big challenge, 
	but it's one that we fully intend to meet and exceed., Will the game be released in multiple countries?, Will the release be simultaneous?, Which countries and what languages will 
	the game be localized in?, Our goal is to release the game simultaneously 
	across the world in multiple languages., As we get closer to release, we'll 
	have more details to share., Will there also be an expansion, and if so, what features will it 
	contain?, Our focus has been and will continue to be on developing and refining the 
	core StarCraft II experience, so we haven't really had much time to consider 
	what types of things we would include with an expansion for the game if we 
	were to do one., Will there be a console version of StarCraft II?, StarCraft II is being developed for the PC., We have no current plans to 
	bring the game to any console platform., Seeing Familiar faces, or not so familiar.., Starcraft II Videos are 
	here in Trailers section ->

I will add mine?Background? I own multiple copies of Warcraft, Warcraft II, Warcraft III, Diablo, Diablo II and of course, SC1., Blizzard North ruled in their early years and put out some really great games that I have gotten literally hundreds of hours of satisfaction out of playing.I also own multiple copies of all of the Starfleet Command series which I bring up only to relate what happened to a great game company when Activision took it over? SFC 3 was a huge disappointment to everyone that loved the first couple installments and were hoping to enjoy a bigger, better and more inclusive 3rd edition.I personally feel that Activision is ran by business executives that are complete idiots when it comes to games? I don?t think they play their own games or care how they come out as long as they are profitable., Numerous examples of game programmers leaving the companies after Activision took them over has reinforced my beliefs over the years?Blizzard North was a great company that made great games?  sadly, it no longer exists., From the day Activision took it over, it was doomed? it is now Activision and it is my personal belief that Activision ruins anything it touches?They ruined numerous Star Trek games? they ruined Starfleet Command? and now they will ruin not only Starcraft, but Warcraft and Diablo as well., Their corporate management is not game friendly., They do not live and breathe the games they sell? to them a game is just an item to make a profit on., Very sad.Anyway, I think it is a shame? hopefully a new software game company will come along and write a great game we can all enjoy., I hope I am wrong, but I no longer believe the next installment of Warcraft or Diablo will be any better than this sad specticle we are seeing with Starcraft.RIP Blizzard North? you are already being mourned and missed?JimReplyJon / July 27, 2010 at 8:32 pmDid you even play the game or did you just make these statements because you don?t like actvision or that starfleet 3(?) was a bad game?Thanks for the insight JimReplyJoe / July 29, 2010 at 7:09 amPreface: I own and love SC1, Warcraft (I & II), and both Diablo???s., Blizzard has completely ruined this game and for this, I REFUSE to buy Diablo III., This game is exactly what happens when the company only cares about how much cash they can stuff in their coffers and not churning out a decent product., Here are my issues;Right off the bat ? all this BNET crap., I paid $60 to play a video game, not submit a urine sample., I understand checking CD keys, I???m OK with that and even providing my email., What I???m not OK is the company that wants my dollar, thinking their above me, and that they should have tabs on all my information so I can be blessed enough to play their video game., This is pure arrogance on Blizzards part.Second, No co-op campaign or LAN., Will someone please send Blizzard a ???Welcome to the 2000???s??? letter?, How they could forgo incorporating either of these is beyond me ??? just some bean counter saying ???Oh, we don???t have the money???The game is essentially the original with better graphics and a couple extra units., I???m hanging this game up and going to play Dawn of War II again.Blizzard should be ashamed., Click here to cancel reply., Submitted by Philipe Mansour on Thu 17:54, If you are wondering about Shokz Starcraft 2 Guide REVIEW, product Creator reputation, or..., You've come to the right place., The Shokz Guide will likely be the complete Starcraft 2 of Mastery Guide., The Starcraft 2 Guide is an in-depth guide teaching you how you can master the Terran, Protoss, and Zerg., Study the key methods and play styles of all 3 races to earn your process to #1 rank Diamond., The Starcraft 2 Guide teaches you every aspect from the game giving you the benefit against any opponent., The Guide has the top rated strategies utilized by the pros so you're able to study the greatest strategy to micro and macro like a diamond player and take over your diamond division., ...[more details]

..and so significantly more., Also to all these fantastic tactics, Shokz posts up tons of new written content and methods numerous times per week comprehensive with pics and videos that could enable you to stay a single step ahead with the competition., After performing my Shokz Guide review, I can't believe of a single other SC2 Guide that rivals the quantity of updates Shokz puts out to make certain his manual stays ahead of the competition., Give it a try currently, you won't be disappointed!, Posted  by Mike in Editorials,  Featured | 4 comments, Starcraft 2 has finally been released and it only took a bit longer than 10 years., ?Even by Blizzard standards 10 years is a long time for a sequel, and even though I glad its finally been released, for some reason I feel like SC2 has been a bit of a let down even though it?s a great game., I?ve been playing SC2 since beta and while fun, it?s the same feel as the original Starcraft, with some new units, powers and buildings., ?Had this been 5 years ago, I wouldn?t really care, but after 10 years of waiting I would have expected more than just a few new units., ?There?s no new gameplay systems or strategy changes in Starcraft 2, you still need to build and gather resources as quickly as possible and create a bigger army than your enemy to win., However Blizzard has added some very nice additions to single player., ?There is a full achievements list that players can get from each mission and once you?ve completed the single player campaign you open up Challenge Mode which provides 9 more Challenges with achievements that are actually great fun., ?I haven?t beat?n them all yet, but I?m working on it., Blizzard also added a lobby system for single player where you can upgrade units and buildings with credits you earn during each mission., ?You also gather Zerg and Protoss research points during missions which can be used to further upgrade your forces., ?The upgrade system added a RPG element to the game which is a welcomed addition and since you can?t earn enough credits to upgrade everything, ?you really have to pick which unit you like using the best and upgrade those., Getting into the actual gameplay, nothing new was really added that would separate it from the original Starcraft., ?All the maps were very well thought out and fun to play, but again nothing really new., ? The new units are obviously fun to play and you?ll need to rethink the strategies you used in the original SC., The graphics change is nice, but the 3D camera is really just a gimmick that Blizzard can use to say SC2 is completely 3D., ?I didn?t once change the camera angle while playing and really don?t see any reason why you would ever, aside from just playing around with it., Overall Starcraft 2 is great game, but after 10 years of waiting I feel like it could have been more., ? The upgrade system is a very nice addition, but that?s really the only new thing that Starcraft 2 introduced., ? Strategies remain the same, build as many units as your can and overwhelm your opponent., While I?m disappointed there weren?t any real changes to Starcraft2, the game is great, extremely polished and reminds me of my days in college playing the original SC to 3am., Starcraft 2 Beta Opens!, Posted on Feb 20, 2010, Posted on Aug 3, 2010, Posted on Jul 31, 2010, Posted on Jul 22, 2010, Posted on Jul 17, 2010, Blogroll

Xbox360 Cheats, August 12, 2010I for one agree on most points in this., Starcraft for me right now has been more about the story line., When I finally finished the campaign I thought it was excellent., This is just as an amazing story line as other Blizzard gaming and I can?t wait to see the Zerg expansion., December 2, 2010I Was Dissapointed even tho its by far the best game ive played (next to starcraft original, bw Suced) The lazers are something gettin used to a little much, but in time i think they will grow on me., And For one Thing to be certain, Ive played a lot of Zerg, And I find Zerg vs Terran Mentally Retarded, Possibly Im still Nub At that match and althought it feels like starcraft 1 i hated that match up, when i played a good game i still won, or had an idea why i lost; This time around imn not seeing a Counter system i can rely on, But then again im still Nub., Next  The Air I Really Like what they?ve done with zerg,  The Bannelings again against terran are completely useless, The Zerglings useless, Mutas useless,  So it becomes a hydra roach game with a few guardians possibly some spells, and again the spells im not really getting it., The Queen thing really got to me,, Like seriously what the fuck is that about?, i find that a little bit weird and not being able to spread creep, but again its starting to grow on me the creep tumours, just the idea of 1 hatchery being more than enuf per base is something getting used to a little more micro management, but is growing on me really cool, But the queens lost wings, and the broodlings almost grew wings,, did anyone notice that, those things (broodlings) glide now lol., but complex in understanding or explaining, the queen was a fast unit in sc 1, how would it lose wings, oddly Enuf Im Really Impresssed, And i not so sure abut the infinite stimming ability i really hope that medivacs get toned down,  Void Rays as well , seriously that is some weirdness, vs a zerg user at least, its a scary sight.., Well Thank You So Much Blizzard Im really Looking Forward to the Zerg Expansion and the toss missions, personally i still fucking hate terran as in sc 1, but at Least sc vanilla, theres not infinite stim, which is one of the maine reasons i never really got down with bw as well as zerg vs toss i felt invincible, Using a lurker,scourge technique they would get trapped i take map in Lt at least, And there observers id just scourge with ovy?s to spot., anywayz, Good Job id Give this game a 8.9 out of 10 I Am Assuming Being a zerg User it will Be A Near Perfect game Upon Release and Perfect after balancing issues, But i favour zerg, Assumedly they are trying to use the expansions and balancing fixes,  Growing upon what consumers liked and didnt like they can evolve the races., So maybe the last Expansion will be (hopefully Unlike bw epic fail) the best expansion Thanks Starcraft, Blizzard And Korea, For making it possible, Much Love*!, ^^ ^_^ -_- (._.)!_!, December 2, 2010Trying to Use The Expansions as Balancing fixes** Sorry typo, Click here to cancel reply., Here is a review of StarCraft 2 by one of the biggest fans of StarCraft EVER., StarCraft 2 genuinely sucks.? This is why:

The storyline mode is lazy, very short, and inconclusive.? Had multiplayer not been included, I would sternly claim that StarCraft 2 is one third of a video game., The storyline itself is even worse; they ruined the StarCraft universe with typical cliche modern video gaming storyline archs and garbage.? 
The characters are HORRIBLE.? I thought the developers of Gears of War had created the most shallow, cliche and unlikable characters.? I was wrong.? They took great StarCraft persona's (Kerrigan, Raynor, Zeratul) and converted them into raw sewage.? For anyone who didn't play the original, Raynor was never head-over-heels with Kerrigan.? They made this shit up., Battle Net 2.0 is like having explosive diarrhea on top of a red-ringed Xbox 360.? It's awful., Blizzard took a functional and spectacular system for hosting a variety of games and turned it into a bastardized version of Xbox Live., Last I checked, there was essentially no more customization of maps.? You can forget trying to get a game going with a random map you made for the hell of it.? All you have is Blizzard's heavily censored publishing system., Gameplay-wise, this is a barely evolved version of the original StarCraft.? They streamlined a few mechanics, such as hotkeys and unit selection, and changed a few units around.? That's literally all they did.? Honestly, though, this is the least of my complaints.? At least the game is still somewhat fun to play., In conclusion, it was deeply vexing to see the total degeneracy of my previously favorite video game universe., However, StarCraft 2 is fun for a few hours.? And aside of from the music and some voice acting, I cannot say much else positive about what should have been the greatest PC sequel of this generation., Otherwise, StarCraft 2, the first of a $180 "trilogy," is simply an illustration of relative devolution of the gaming industry.? Expensive and ostentatiously brief games comprised of censorship and diluted flashiness preclude epic experiences qualitative and quantitavely high in substance and intelligent, provocative design., I need to get a new Xbox 360.? Anyone have any ideas on cheap, new ones?? I don't care if it has a HD., That is all for now., ?

Website reviewed: Starcraft 2 Secrets

and was not sure?what to expect., I figured at this point I had seen it all.., Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Starcraft 2 Secrets is a solid strategy guide that
actually?lives up to its promise?to and deliver strategys and secrets that I had not seen in any other
guide on the market., My favorite thing about Starcraft 2 Secrets is that the strategies are crystal clear; all the guess-work is
taken out of the equation., The exact build order for each strategy is given?and there are literally a dozen or
more different build orders for each race!, Click Here to Visit Starcraft 2, Secrets

Additionally, all strategies are ranked by skill, which is a great addition., One of the major
problems with a lot of other strategy guides is that they do not distinguish between strategies for newbies and
strategies for advanced players., In Starcraft 2 Secrets, you do not have to worry about that, as the author has
ranked all the tactics from 1-5 stars., Bronze league players can use the 1-star strategies to get into the Silver League, Silver league players can use

Starcraft 2 is a safe bet., If there's one thing that is ever-present throughout the gameplay of Starcraft 2, it's that the game doesn't want to rock the boat., It knows it has a winning formula, and it sticks to it., That's not to say that the formula is old, contrived, or left completely alone., Blizzard has refined Starcraft 2 to perfection, and while it certainly resembles Starcraft, it has been improved in every way., Those that take the plunge into Wings of Liberty will find themselves going back to the original Starcraft wishing it played like its sequel., Note: This review contains mild spoilers
Gallery: StarCraft 2 ScreenshotsStarcraft 2's story picks up 4 years after the end of Brood War., Kerrigan and her Zerg swarm have been ominously silent, and the Protoss and Terran have taken advantage of the lull in warfare to rebuild and improve their weapons of war., Arcturus Mengsk, realizing that Jim Raynor is the biggest threat to his hold over Terran space, has marginalized the ex-marshal and forced him into a life of mercenary work and backwoods guerrilla warfare., All this changes when an old friend from Raynor's criminal days, Tychus Findlay, shows up with a proposition for work involving an alien artifact., Coincidentally, the Zerg also decide to invade around the time Raynor gets his hands on the artifact, forcing him to take a greater hand (once again) in the affairs of the Koprulu sector., The Starcraft story has always been cheesy pulp science-fiction, and the same can be said of Starcraft 2., There's not a whole lot new here in terms of characterization, and cliches abound., Tychus and Tosh are especially notable cliches, as the convict and voodoo master respectively., Raynor himself has a few cheesy lines, but is overall a very likable character with good humor and a strong sense of right and wrong., It's also great that characters from the offshoots, such as Nova (from Starcraft: Ghost) and Valerian Mengsk (from the novels) see canonization in the main storyline instead of being forgotten., Other old faces also make returns, such as Zeratul, Artanis, and even the conniving Samir Duran., Naturally, the storyline is only present in the single-player., While the previous Starcraft game elucidated the storyline in briefings, occasional in-game talking, and brief cutscenes, Starcraft 2 goes whole hog on the information overload., No matter where you are, the story is there, from the exploration of the Hyperion to the talking head sequences in missions., Learning about the universe is much more interactive, and it encourages you to find things out on your own., If you don't want to, though, you can always skip it., Blizzard also rolled out the cutscene department for some truly stunning cinematics, showing that they are among the best when it comes to lush, fluid animation., The Hyperion is more than just cutscene fodder, however., There are a number of activities that pertain to your in-game, which adds a meta-game to the single-player., First of these is Stettman's research, which manifests as a series of difficult binary choices about upgrades to your forces., Want vastly tougher bunkers, or bunkers with turrets on top?, A unit that can mind control zerg, or a unit that slows them down?, These choices are rarely easy, and allow for replayability, as they are set in stone once selected., The second activity is hiring mercenaries from Hill., Mercenaries are incredibly tough versions of normal units, such as Marines or Goliaths., However, they are only available in small squads, or in one case, a single ship., Finally, there's upgrading your forces in the armory., By funding the research of Swann, you can increase the effectiveness of certain troops on the field, such as making medics heal faster or giving Thors an area-of-effect stun., These abilities are also permanent, and there is not enough money to buy everything., Starcraft 2's single-player is perhaps the first we have played where the story was not the reason to play through the game., Wings of Liberty contains 29 missions: 22 normal missions, six branching missions (choose one or the other), and one secret mission., Not a single one of these missions feels out of place, boring, or ordinary., Some do resemble older missions (the third bears resemblance to a mission from Starcraft) and others are a variation on previously played mission objectives, but all of them are unique., One mission has you mining in the middle of an unstable landscape, picking up every time lava floods the area., Another has you chasing down trains and gunning them down for the valuables inside., Yet another is a mission with a night and day cycle that resembles the most distressing zombie movies., Not a single mission is the simple "build up, attack enemy base, win" that was so prevalent in the older games., If anything, Blizzard knew that there had to be fundamental gameplay differences between single-player and multiplayer for the campaign to be compelling., There are a few concerns about the single-player that are worth addressing., One prominent assumption it is merely one-third of a game., It most certainly is not., While the overarching story arc is not resolved, Jim Raynor's personal arc certainly is., Not only that, but the single-player has as many missions as the original game did, but focusing on the Terrans instead of dividing the attention among all three., The result is a cohesive snippet that, while completed, fits within a larger arc., Those that prefer to not play as the Terrans the entire time will have to wait until later games for their respective races, although a taste of the Protoss is given in one mission arc., The single-player is also relatively non-linear., While the first and last three missions are totally linear, the missions in the middle are divided into story arcs., Each story arc is linear, but you can play the latest mission from any story arc at any time., This means you can hop back and forth between arcs, if you really want to., It's also a great way to circumvent frustration., If you are stuck on a mission, simply do a different arc to get better units/armaments, then go back to the mission you were having difficulty with., A valid problem with the single-player is the necessity of being online., While you can play offline, it is glitchy in saving your progress and may even crash., You also don't get achievements., The Battle.Net requirement to the single-player campaign can be seen as a sort of DRM, and DRM is always a nasty affair., However, there's a few alleviating factors., You can play offline, which will no doubt be patched to be less buggy in regards to saves., Your saves are stored online., There are achievements which unlock portraits that work in multiplayer., You can go seamlessly from the campaign to multiplayer., You can chat through the Battle.Net service without leaving your game., Still, if you aim to avoid online-focused DRM, you might wait for Starcraft 2's offline action to get fixed., Next >>Tags: blizzard, featured, review, starcraft-2Permalink Email this   Recent Posts

Click the tags below to explore similar content, No Related Replays available., StarCraft 2 beta had been launched not so long ago and along with it came the brand new replay system - showcased by Blizzard in their Battle Reports., It's been hyped by the developers plenty., People theorized about what features would be included and whether it'd live up to the expectations., Everyone had their personal list of features they'd like to see implemented: from first person view, through being able to watch replays with friends online (which was already possible in its predecessor), backwards compatibility, replay rewinding - said by Blizzard to be especially hard to code - or even WaaaghTV/HLTV equivalent., Some of them made it, whereas others did not make the cut, waiting to potentially get added in a content patch after release or in an expansion pack., Without any further ado, let us take a closer look at the StarCraft 2 replay system, remembering that usually the good comes with the bad.The Good.The replay system is accessible right after you log on to Battle.net., By default, your replays are categorized into several main folders., All your games are automatically saved in "Recent" folder., You can, however, organize your replay library however you want, by using custom made folders., By clicking on the replay, you can see what map it's played on and what players are playing in it., To load it you either double click it or press the "LOAD" button., You can save replays stored in "Recent" replays in the "Multiplayer" folder, changing their name as you please, however, you can't move them freely to other folders or simply change their names., You can also delete them.The main screen of the replay system.As you can see, the new replay system allows for more interface freedom than any other Blizzard replay system to date., The most obvious change is the addition of an independent window for the game speed and time controls., This means that when watching replays, the unit information, and more importantly, the unresearched upgrades are clearly visible in the bottom right corner, as they would be in a normal game., This allows one to quickly see whether a player has made a certain upgrade from that structure, and also to see what units they have the tech to build., The maximal fast forward speed is x6, which seems to be enough., You can, obviously, watch the game on slower settings - helpful for analyzing battles., The only small complaint we have with the progress bar is that you're unable to hide it in any way., At times, it spoils the fun for people watching replays for entertainment purposes.Another new addition, which is harder to show in a picture, is replay rewinding, by developers referred to as time jumping., Yes, Blizzard has finally made it so that one can move freely backwards through a replay in their games., While this system may have some kinks we have not found, it looks to be fairly robust, and will be very useful for tracking things that go on that would otherwise be missed or studying build orders., One small caveat is that while the game automatically makes bookmarks for events that have occurred, allowing for a quick jump back, you cannot jump forward at all., You can, however, increase the speed to fast forward., This is not likely to change, as doing so would require a lot of pre-loading that Blizzard is not likely to bother implementing at this stage.Rewinding in action.The new replay system also allows you to see each player's first person view by selecting one of them and clicking on the Player Camera icon., Afterward you're able to see his/her screen movement, mouse clicks and unit/building selection with his hotkeys (displayed at all times) on top of that., The mouse movement, however, is not displayed as it isn't registered in the replay file., This is essentially an extension of a Brood War plug-in that allowed for more or less the same thing.As in Brood War, you can see the player's resources and unit count simply by selecting any of his units or buildings., To see his field of vision you need to select him in the players' tab like in WarCraft 3., However, StarCraft 2 has MUCH more to offer., In the top-left corner, there is a drop-down menu that allows one to select one of various statistic windows., While this was possible in Brood War with some clever plugins, they were somewhat cumbersome to use, tended to clutter the screen, and had to be maintained separately., Now that Blizzard has integrated this feature into the replay system, watching and commentating on replays becomes much easier., They also help you understand the match you're currently watching far better than ever before.Resources.Units.ArmyActions Per MinuteLast but not least, when you update any game, oftentimes replay and save data is broken, since those depend on the game's internal data being unchanged., However, now you no longer have to worry about losing all your precious replays as soon as a new patch comes out., Yes, StarCraft 2 features backwards compatibility!, Whenever you try to load a replay from an older version of the game, StarCraft 2 client asks you politely whether you want to relaunch the game with an older patch., Then you simply watch the game normally., 123Continue to Next Page..., Licensed to: GameReplays.org, Select Category

Hardened Shields, as even a fully upgraded Marine does only 9 damage., For more information on the Terran Marine and other units please visit starcraft Strategy Guide

When we left off, in 1998, the insectoid Zerg had just betrayed the technologically-advanced Protoss and Terran armies, wiping out all life on planet Char., The Protoss homeworld of Aiur had been thoroughly ravaged, an infant Overmind had been destroyed, and renegade Terran hero Jim Raynor was fleeing the might of the oppressive Dominion forces led by backstabbing sod Arcturus Mengsk., These days, Jim Raynor is a broken man., His waking hours are spent sitting alone in bars, knocking back bottles of whiskey and listening to a cover version of Free Bird., At night his dreams are haunted by the Zerg rushing his one-time love Sarah Kerrigan,  back when she was still human and not an oddly attractive Zerg Queen ? one that resembles a cross between Tricia Helfer (who now provides the voice) and the work of H., Also, I am 24 in a month., ?Advertisement<a href="http://chappel.videogamer.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=af7e201b&amp;cb=888667" target="_blank"><img src="http://chappel.videogamer.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=27&amp;source=&amp;cb=744516&amp;n=af7e201b" border="0" alt="" /></a>The more things change, the more they stay the same., The StarCraft of 2010 is not the StarCraft of 1998, but it does such a good job of respecting its source material you might end up thinking you're basically playing the same game., You'd be wrong.Crucially, there's an all-important divide between the single and multiplayer components., The former's campaign, the heart of StarCraft's burgeoning space opera, has you controlling Raynor's renegade forces on the Hyperion, his personal Battlecruiser., Keeping the narrative grounded to Raynor's perspective, with the majority of levels based around the Terran race, gives Blizzard's designers the chance to breathe, to let the game unfold at a more comfortable pace and create levels that bring out the best from each unit., New toys are introduced into the game on a one-by-one basis; each mission encourages you to your latest prize to accomplish the demands of each particular scenario., Levels are glued together by impressive in-engine cutscenes, the occasional lavish FMV sequence and plenty of pottering about on your ship to spend money and research points ? we?ll talk about the latter in a moment., The Hyperion is far more than just a giant spaceship with a massive pew-pew laser: it has its own laboratory, armoury, bridge and cantina, with each RPG-lite area presented as a moving image rather than as an interactive environment., The effect ends up feeling like a screen from a 90s adventure game, only with fancier technology., A renewed focus on plot, atmosphere and setting is complimented by the fundamental mechanics of the game., Blizzard's often-criticised decision to focus on the Terrans actually pays dividends when it comes to tailoring a squad over the 16-odd hour duration of the main campaign., Giving 29 lengthy missions to one race grants the supporting cast time to develop, resulting in a cohesive narrative that turns the experience into far more than a disconnected series of missions linked together by a loose plot., The ending's not bad, either., The last 12 years has seen the original StarCraft lifted to untouchable status in the gaming canon - and deservedly so., Cast the nostalgia to one side, however, and you'll realise the story, especially some of the stuff introduced in the Brood War expansion, was a bit silly: fluff, filler and intentionally vague topics about Protoss/Zerg clones, an Earth faction and a Xel'Naga disguising himself as a Terran., StarCraft II has its own daft moments, but it's a tighter, more controlled storyline that distils and expands upon the core elements that proved a success in the original: Raynor, Kerrigan and Mengsk., ??

Dont listen to ignorant people who refuse to like the game based on rediculous arguments., Try it out for yourself!, Chris says: July 30, 2010 at 6:23 amReplyYeah the blizzard publicy machine must be working overtime on reviewing itself., Given that they took so long to release it there were only two possibilities: It would either be the best thing since sliced bread or, as I suspected, the people in charge didn?t know what they were doing., Unfortunately my suspicions proved correct.The cinematic sequences are very good, but the rest of the game sucks., The movement engine has the same flaws as the original with units getting suck behind buildings or on terrain on a regular basis (Gameplay is far from flawless)., the graphics though more detailed are sillier for the zerg & protoss making hard to take them seriously.Extra units make the terrans more interesting but the added complexity interferes with the fast paced gameplay that was one of the hallmarks of the original.The storyline of the campaign is a typical cliche designed to appeal to 13-15 year old boys.Multiplayer must run through Blizzards battlenet making the game close to useless without a very good broadband connection., No LAN parties with this one.Overall there is no way an independant reviewer would give this anywhere close to 100% unless they?re hyped up on some stim packs.With a few simple changes this could have been an excellent game but as they say the devil is in the details., Basically they should have not some real gamers design this, not a bunch of suits.Graphics, 4/10  blah says: July 30, 2010 at 7:36 amReplyi havent even opened it since they bumped it up another 20 bucks in my area, fuck that i aint paying 100 bucks for 1/3 of the campaign based around the fucking race i HATE the most, ill just download a cracked version and wait for heart of the swarm and legacy of the void but what i was getting at was im really dissapointed in the campaign from what ive seen aswell i saw the end of it and was like ?wow that is so fucking stupid?*spoiler alert*kerrigan should stay zerg she is meant to be the queen of fucking blades for gods sake!, i played in the beta and i liked the gameplay so i dont completley agree with you, but i do agree with you about the fucking campaign  beau says: July 30, 2010 at 1:26 pmReplyAnd one more thing:I'm sorry, you just came off looking like a contrarian idiot who hasn't even played the game., The only valid point your entire comment had was the lack of LAN, but even that was faulted by your claim that the game is close to useless without a "very good broadband connection." I have incredibly erratic broadband, it fluctuates between being very good (10 mbits) or being almost unusable (less than 1 mbit)., (usually within the same hour) I spent the weekend playing a few games, and I had barely any lag., Get off your dial-up modem, it's time to upgrade., Blahhhh says: August 2, 2010 at 4:09 pmReplyIt sounds like you're not a fan of RTS games, so no shit, you wouldn't enjoy SC2., "units getting suck behind buildings or on terrain on a regular basis " ? Haha, what?, You're blaming the game for your lack of ability., First, Blizzard has never been in the business of making their games uber-realistic, and that's part of their charm., WarCraft 3 had relatively cartoony art, so did WoW., Second, uh, making something more realistic implies that they exist in real life., As far as I know, we haven't come in contact with any Zerg or Protoss yet., I guess I could be wrong, but I think Blizzard can use their creative license in this case., BlahSucks says: August 2, 2010 at 4:08 pmReplyJust spent 8 hours getting the game installed., In an area with less than dial up internet access, the patch was a pointless waste of time? it should have been shipped ready to go for campaign playing.If this is the trend Blizzard are going to use then I won't be buying Diablo., With no interest in PVP playing I want to play the campaigns and leave it at that., I will never buy a stand alone game that is licensed as opposed to purchased ever again., Once bitten, twice shy., Logging in every time sucks, especially with the connection I have.Gameplay feels archaic, a UI that goes back to the old warcraft days and not much has changed., RTS games are about how you interface with them, this fails and I feel like I have gone back 5 years in time., Story line and main characters are crass, cheesey and unimaginative.If you want an RTS that trumps this hands down with a better mechanics and UI then I suggest Command and Conquer 3 or 4., G_G says: July 30, 2010 at 12:25 pmReplyI can't find out what they were working on for more than 5 years on this piece of crap., SC I battlechest 19.99 this 1/3 of a game 59.99., I feel like I wasted $60.00., game goes to uninstall and directly to the trash., bmw says: August 2, 2010 at 6:25 amReplyStarCraft 2 Video Review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kwEXXebT4A full review from BadSec (ex-GameStar): http://www.gladriel.com/reviewFull/content/3761/S..., stiliom says: August 3, 2010 at 10:18 amReply Click here to cancel reply., I was sceptical, I must admit., The lack of LAN, the "trilogy" effect, the way RTS games seem to be moving away from dirt farming to get you straight into the action., Curiosity did, however, kill the cat and I bought the game last night., I don't feel anything for the main character, nor his rather deep voiced friend., Their situation feels all to.., Scripted, there doesn't even seem to be an air of what I would consider "natural interaction" between the two., That seems to be exclusively between the Captain and the main character, which considering the supposed history between Tychus and Raynor, is surprising to say the least., However, for me RTS games have always been about the gameplay rather than the characters in the single player., I've only cruised through a few missions (Is it me, or does there seem to be very little difference between casual/normal/hard and then a rather large jump to Brutal?) so far, but the gameplay is remarkably good., There are a few things that irk me, though., Control groups - You can set them, but you can't unset them., I was playing one mission, that involved collecting 8000 minerals, and as such had two groups of SCVs doing the collecting, and of course, two command centres., I labeled 'em up, but I cocked up control grouping some of the SCV's, when I went to reset that, it became clear that once that'd happened, that was that., Short of adding the ones that were contaminated with another number, to yet another number (EG: In group 9 I had some of group 8, so selecting 9 also selected some of 8, and the only way to correct this would be to manually select what should be 9, assign them to 7, and use 9 for something else)., Medics - No matter how I play, the dozy bints trundle to the front of the fight, and just stand there., Yes, they need to be near the troops taking the brunt of the damage, but not between my troops and the enemy., Granted, that becomes a non-issue when I build my force up, as very often when it gets to a certain point, the restorative power combined with the speed of death dealing prevents anything from getting taken anyway., Otherwise, I agree with the review., It is a nice game, and I regret doubting it., Done., StarCraft + Mass Effect + Fire Fly = StarCraft 2, Quote:Originally Posted by MajorTomStarCraft + Mass Effect + Fire Fly = StarCraft 2

Some ass always finds posts like this and then comes in to demolish folks like us in 3 minutes :(, Such a shame i loathe and detest RTS games......as it looks quite nice., I dont know why i hate them so much, but i can never seem to get past the tutorial and about the first 2 levels on any RTS game, before mind numbing boredom sets in.., Quote:Flying in the face of twelve years of development in the RTS genre, there is no way StarCraft 2 should be any good., Hadn?t we moved on from unit churning mechanics, complex resource systems and base building?, Games such as Company of Heroes and Dawn of War 2 have streamlined the experience, simplifying and cutting out all the fluff to leave us with a much more concentrated type of strategy game., It's actually this aspect of the game I find most appealing, even though I've never played the first game and is too expensive for me to consider as a single player only game (not interested in the multiplayer)., Games like CoH are good in their own right, but there are times I just want to play an old-school RTS with modern production values, and I think the only other game to do that recently was SupCom., Tsung 29th July 2010, 11:06, LOL, Multiplayer pratice against the A.I.?, has one setting.., Whilst I was building my first Marine unit, the AI walks in and stomps on me with an army., That was on Easy setting (2vs2 as well)., Ok i'm still learning, im sure the AI is beatable, but please, looking at it's build speeds.., 1 second in the game and it's already started to build miners., It's built an whole army by the time I've got the resources and worked out how to build a single marine., What happened during the long beta period?, Maybe Blizzard should offer beta access to genuinely new players to RTS., Ok I accept it's early doors, I still need to learn the units, I still need to do the practice league maybe there are real people (like me) out there who don't play that quickly., My advice is to go into the practice league for anyone who thinks they are going to get stomped online but want to try the game., It's specifically set up to be beginner friendly., Theres only 3 maps  so you get to know the maps really well, they have plenty of easy expansion points, and they have special rock barriers to make rushing very difficult., Give that a go., You get 50 practice games and they don't affect any future ranking so you can experiment with crazy strategies., Quote:Originally Posted by CardJoePfft., Humbug.I'm with Joe on this!, Maybe I'll retry the original, after I've cleared my backlog of games., I am old enough to have played the original, but I can't say I found anything outstanding about it and as a result only played it a few times., I'm not sure what to make of this, there's a part of me that thinks I should get it to play with my friends, as surely there must be something good about it., But then I remember that the only good fun I've had with any Blizzard RTS is tower defence, and that doesn't justify the price., I also hate overly zoomed in camera's with venemously (a la recent C&Cs), so these screens aren't doing much to persuade me!, Oh wait, you click on the picture then it expands..., I stand corrected on that last point!, Will be buying this tomorrow., I have to have it., Loved the first, loved the beta, WILL LOVE THIS., At least this review should (although I very much doubt it) shut up the ridiculous haters crying that just because there are three games, then they must only be one third of a game each., I haven't much time to play it, but my first thought was:
"This is the first let down EVER from blizzard"., Not a total let down, but it isn't a top notch game like they use to do., I may be wrong, because i've just played up to level 5., Looking forward to playing this, it sounds ace, only thing putting me off is the ?32-35 price and it not being on Steam., Does the DVD need to be in the drive to play this?, as I hate that when it's all on the hard drive anyway which is why I only buy games on Steam., If it doesn't I might buy it., Also how much is it to buy and download from battle.net?, They make you create an account before they tell you the price!, By Matt Peckham, PCWorld
		??, Guaranteeing an internet dust-up, Amazon StarCraft II buyers (or users posing as such) have posted a litany of complains about Blizzard's just released PC real-time strategy sequel to 1998's StarCraft., The current Amazon rating with 46 customer reviews is around 2.5 stars out of 5, a mediocre grading at best (the collector's edition fares better, with just three reviews, at 4.5 stars of 5)., To be fair, most of the 26 one-star ratings currently dragging the game down come from users upset about the game's absent LAN play., In May, Blizzard admitted LAN play was out, but claimed it was to ensure a "united community" via its Battle.net matchmaking servers--not, as many assumed, to thwart pirates., "I want to have control over my game," wrote one one-star grumbler., "That means I want to play online how I want to play.", "I want to play SC2 on my laptop when I'm on a road trip with no Internet., [Note: This is actually possible, via the game's offline mode.] I want to bring said laptop or a LAN machine with the game with a buddy's house and play on LAN., Anyone who paid for this game should demand this.", "Forcing people to be on Battlenet to play = massive fail," wrote another one-star reviewer., "How dare you tell your paying customer how they can and cannot play?, They paid for a copy of your product, and it turns out that they NEVER actually own it., A few were miffed about the game's singular campaign., While the original StarCraft had three--Terran, Zerg, and Protoss--StarCraft II ships with only the Terran campaign., Two expansion are planned, covering the Zerg and Protoss campaigns respectively., After expressing disappointment about the lack of LAN play, one reviewer added "To make matters worse, you only get the terran campaign...if you want the zerg and protoss campaign, you have to dish out another $120.00 (plus tax)!", "Greed has ruined Blizzard," the user opines, calling for players to "pass on World of Starcraft.", It's not all bad news for Blizzard's latest., Another 16 users give the game 4-5 stars out of 5, and generally praise it for its graphical polish, audio cues, multiplayer potential, and enhanced single-player story., "I for one, am really loving this game," wrote a five-star reviewer., "In regards to many peoples complaints about the game, these where things that Blizzard announced long before release date., If LA[N]

when I would lose a game I never had a chance in., Sometimes these Starcraft 2 games would take upwards of thirty minutes before I found out I never even had a chance., What I love most about

Starcraft 2 Terran Build Orders Playing any race in Starcraft 2 can be
difficult if you don't have a set strategy to work with or if you're
playing for the first time; even the Terran race can be difficult if
not played correctly., There are some tips that you can take to
heart, however, when playing as Terran against the other races in the
game.What Are Terrans Best At?, Terrans are good at quite a few things,
but the things you want to concentrate on most are infantry and siege
weapons., It's great to specialize in one of the two, but you never
want to stick all your eggs in one basket., Getting too specialized
is dangerous and can leave your forces crippled in other areas where
you need to be able to counter your opponent., Simple Strategies For Starcraft 2 Terran Build Order Success

There are a couple of main, easy
strategies that you can use when playing the Terran race., One of the
best builds concentrates on mechs and siege engines., Mechs are great
against both infantry and air attacks., Hellions are particularly
useful against infantry due to the efficiency of their internal
flamethrowers and adding some Viking air units to this mix can
increase your tactical prowess by leaps and bounds., The next thing you could do is just go
for a strict air assault on your opponents with both Banshees and
Vikings; Banshees will efficiently protect you by air while Vikings
protect you from your enemy's ground troops., MMM Strategy

The strategy affectionately called
?MMM? by avid players is very popular and stands for ?marines,
marauders, and medivac dropships?., It is one of the first

	|??DLC (3), Welcome to another video game review here on machinima.com I?m Rob Talbert and today we are checking out the long anticipated sequel, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty., It?s been over a decade since the original StarCraft was released, question is, does the sequel have enough new bells and whistles to satiate long time fans of the series, or is this game stuck in the past and are there enough new players that have never played an RTS to be interested in it?? Time to find out., Story
Right off the bat I have to say that the story was my biggest concern going into StarCraft 2., It has been over a decade since this universe has been explored or updated with a new game and the guys at Blizzard have a lot of rabid fans waiting to find out what happens next in the series., Luckily for all of us, Blizzard totally knocked it out of the park., StarCraft II?s story is absolutely brilliant., It brings back many of the characters we loved from the first game like Jim Raynor, pseudo leader of the Terran, and Kerrigan, the Queen of Blades, the new leader of the Zerg, and thrusts them headfirst into a continuation of the narrative., Without giving away too much, in Wings of Liberty you are in command of Jim Raynor and the Terrans (for most of the game) and are tasked with hunting down Xal Naga artifacts that may be able to bring down the Queen of Blades who has recently reemerged and is wrecking havoc on some of the outlying Terran planets., The Protoss are peppered throughout the story, but remember that Wings of Liberty is focused on the Terrans specifically so you aren?t getting much in the way of story progression for the Protoss or Zerg., Overall though, the story is one of the main reasons this game is so great., It?s engaging, exciting, and will definitely leave you wanting more once you finally barrel through the 16-plus hours of gameplay in the single-player mode., StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is a great setup for what will surely be an epic tale when the next two games of the announced trilogy are released., Gameplay
StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty for those of you that don?t know, is Real-Time Strategy game., This is a genre that has become a little stale in recent years, with no real advances in the gameplay style despite efforts to bring classic series like Command & Conquer to consoles., While Starcraft II doesn?t make any real advances itself it does have a way of making you feel at times that you aren?t playing an RTS., The normal base construction, unit micromanagement, and mineral harvesting are all still there, but Blizzard has created a very unique mission structure in the single-player that makes the game play like something different than a traditional RTS.? The way that Blizzard has crafted the mission design in Wings of Liberty is an achievement in itself., Sometimes you will be racing to collect minerals faster than an opponent in order to hire a mercenary squad, or you will be on a lava filled planet that erupts with lava every so often causing you to constantly move your bases, or you will be in command of a small force of units on a stealthy mission to infiltrate a prison and release inmates., All of these missions and many more are a great way to advance the story in single-player that keep the standard RTS formula fresh., On that note, the RTS in Wings of Liberty is pitch perfect., The game has taken a genre that is stalling and injected new angles to play the game that make it very refreshing., Each of the races?Protoss, Terran, and Zerg?are extremely well balanced, all of the new unit additions in the game are excellent, and, while some of units from the first game have been removed, these core reasons make picking up and playing this game a new and fresh experience to veterans and newcomers alike., In addition to the normal RTS gameplay mechanic StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty has to offer, the game also adds in a semi-RPG element that takes place in between missions., Raynor can wander around the ship and talk with other crew members and even upgrade and research new abilities to units and buildings using credits earned by completing missions., It?s a welcome addition that helps make the world feel more fleshed out than in a typical RTS experience., One of the greatest aspects of SCII: Wings of Liberty is the inclusion of the map editor; it allows you to create your own maps and gametypes., A slew of maps are already uploaded and available to play on Battle.net and there is no end in sight., This alone should keep the game fresh and engaging for years to come., Multiplayer
One of the biggest selling points for Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty is the multiplayer., This is the sequel one of the most successful and long-lasting multiplayer experiences in history., You can rest assured that the multiplayer component in SCII is brilliant, thanks largely in part to a revamped Battle.net., The new Battle.net has a streamlined feel to it, it?s extremely easy to add and manage friends online now., Chatting is a breeze and setting up parties and games has never been easier in an RTS game., There are even online ranks and achievements that you can unlock as you play the game more and all of these are shown and manageable in your Battle.net profile, which keeps your activities extremely competitive online., You can play good old competitive multiplayer with a maximum of eight players total in a game, or take on the computer with friends online in cooperative modes., Graphics
Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty looks phenomenal., The in-game graphics are polished to perfection., All of the units have their own unique animations and look phenomenal when you zoom in close to them., The environments in the game are all beautiful as well; there was never a time when I felt like I was playing over the same map again., Blizzard has managed to craft a vast amount of very unique looking locations that will really help to extend the game?s shelf life for years to come., The cutscenes are absolutely jaw-dropping., It?s amazing to see characters a decade old get the full HD polish they deserve., While this is all great, you are going to need a pretty beefy machine if you want to run Starcraft II fully optimized and looking its absolute best., Bottom Line
We have been waiting 12 years for a new entry in the series., While that?s a long time, I?m really glad that Blizzard took their time to really examine what made the first game so great and incorporate that and new elements into its sequel., The wait is over, the time it took to create this game paid off, and now we are all able to enjoy the single greatest real-time strategy game ever crafted., Now we just hope its not another 12 year wait before the next game in the series, Heart of the Swarm?

Expand, 23 of 43 users said yes, I just don't get it., The story is boring and doesn't grab you, the graphics are nothing amazing and the game is lacking a number of important features, e.g., LAN play., Sure this is a decent game if you want the same gameplay you had 12 years ago, but no way does it deserve the kind of perfect scores it's getting.? Expand, Twelve years in the making and the release of this game winds up similar to COD: Modern Warfare 2., While less features are considered such as no LAN, possibly few add-ons, a constant Internet connection and similar Facebook content are something I would NOT like to see in a PC game., Sure 30 missions in a game may be quite convincing for one campaign along with the looks of improved graphics., If this game is released with all three campaigns with at least as much missions and lasted as long as Grand Theft Auto IV and the acquired features I am looking for, I would own this game for $100., Therefore this game isn't by far unique and worth the price on features from what Relic's Company of Heroes had.? Expand, Login to rate., Rate this:, See all 15 Critic Reviews, One of those rare games that is not overly complex, but provides a challenging and fun gaming experience., It never seems to get old or boring., All this publication's reviewsRead full review, Another glowing aspect of StarCraft is its absolutely brilliant Campaign Editor., This is the very best make-your-own game interface ever made., All this publication's reviewsRead full review, The distinctive races, units, spell abilities, and bases are all unique and clever, so it's amazing that the game is as well balanced as it is., This is what gameplay is all about., All this publication's reviewsRead full review, Write a Review, This game is never getting old :) Now that SC2 is finally out I put my Starcraft cd-s onto my shelves.., One week before Starcraft 2 Beta I was still playing with the 1st sequel and i have been creating and scripting custom maps for that game for years!!, Starcraft had a solid potential to be an epic RTS game but unfortunately the vast amount of hype surrounding it seems misplaced., The game plays like any other RTS of the time, many people claim that Starcraft was the first RTS ever made, which again seems to be an example of fan boys over hyping the game., The first real RTS is arguably Dune 2, or it's later spin-off Command & Conquer., This is my main problem with Starcraft, there is virtually no originality in it., The gameplay seems to be a direct rip-off of Command & Conquer, with the races all being a cheap rip-off of three of the races from Warhammer 40,000., The actual gameplay in Starcraft seems pretty solid but once you realise that the Blizzard almost completely copy and pasted other content into the game it soon loses all it's appeal., Also what annoys me, and this has nothing to do with Blizzard is the majority of fanboys who flame anyone who disagrees with Starcraft being a perfect game., Perhaps if you opened your eyes to other games you'd enjoy gaming more., I have respect for Rash M's review as he seems to also not be brainwashed by Blizzards attempted epic.? Expand, 1 of 3 users said yes, A very traditional RTS game that brought nothing new to the table., The interface was quite unwieldy and dated considering it came out in 1998., The actual strategy/tactics emphasis was quite low, and battles were mostly stats vs stats and numbers vs numbers.? Expand, Comments are closed., When I first started playing Starcraft 2 it sucked., How do you like spending upwards of 35 minutes of your time, just to have a loss on your record?, I didn?t like it either., It is a love-hate relationship though, am I right?, We love the challenge., We love how the game seems to scream at us, You?ll Never Win!, We laugh and laugh and say trust me, you are so wrong game, I will master you., This is the key to mastering Starcraft 2:Shokz Starcraft 2 strategy guide., This guide is for truly dedicated players who really want to master the game!, Take a look at this cool video:, The Shokz Starcraft 2 Strategy Guide Review Boring Details Section:

Four years after the events chronicled in the original StarCraft, we find our hero, Jim Raynor, still fighting the good fight against the Dominion (a tyrannical human government) that rules the galaxy's outer planets with an iron fist., The Zerg (a primitive, but ruthless insect-like army) are now on the run as Terran (human) forces pick off their dwindling numbers?but little do the Terrans know that the Zerg are merely playing possum., As the Zerg finally spring their attack, Jim Raynor and company must deal with Dominion forces, Zerg infestations, and Protoss (a psionic race of humanoid alien) relations., View Slideshow
See all (10) slides, Gameplay
One thing Blizzard does well is make immersive, addicting titles., StarCraft II fits the bill., It's an RTS game through and through; you oversee offense, defense, and various stages of production of military units., The best part is there's no one set strategy that guarantees success; you have to be able to adapt to the changing conditions of the mission and the environment., For example, one of the starting missions, "The Devil's Playground," takes place on a volcanic planet., I was tasked with collecting minerals from the low ground., Every few minutes, the area would flood with lava, which forced me to keep track of, and evacuate, my gathering units, while simultaneously looking for my next dig site., I had to make sure I frugally spent the minerals I had gathered, and had to wisely plan out and maintain a solid mobile defense., There are 26 exciting missions in total; each time you finish one, there are usually three or four to choose from., In one, I had to defend refugees at night from Zerg swarms and go out during the day to destroy the hives., During my first night there, I found the attacking Zerg were actually infected citizens who became shambling mutations, begging me to kill them., In other missions, you might protect refugees that the Dominion has left for dead, or try to learn more about your enemies and their weapons., On the latter missions, you'll be looking for Protoss or Zerg-specific items that will help you upgrade your weapons, armor, and more., You might even find yourself search for artifacts for the mysterious Mobius organization, but, beware, the Zerg's Queen of Blades might be on the hunt as well..., Between missions, players are stationed on the Hyperion spaceship., There they can speak with crewmates to gain insight on current events, upgrade armor, visit the lab, or go to the bridge to select your next mission., After a mission is completed there's a cinematic that uses the in-game graphics to introduce either a major plot point or a tidbit of advice or information., My sole gameplay gripe is relatively minor: I didn't like that the camera movement was based on either moving the mouse to the edge of the screen or using the arrow keys., I would have preferred to use the W, A, S, and D keys for movement, as a mouse on the edge of a screen isn't quite as precise, and righties will have to take their hands off the mouse to move with the arrow keys., Graphics and Music
The 1998-vintage sprites of the previous edition of StarCraft are replaced with 3D polygonal graphics., Well, some gamers have stated that StarCraft's beauty is in its personality, not its looks., But many modern gamers judge titles with a zeal for appearances worthy of beauty-pageant judges., Compared to the kind of graphics that have spoiled us in games like God of War III, StarCraft II's seem last generation., That's not to say that the graphics are bad?but they are inconsistent., StarCraft II is like two different games in one., The landscapes pop and soldiers are well designed (and there are some high-end cinematic scenes), but when the game shifts to the Hyperion, the visuals aren't quite as grand., The generally conservative graphics requirement do help those not endowed with Core i7 processors, like I have in my Alienware M11x ($1,175 direct, )., Blizzard has been known to dumb down the pixels to save gamers from needing to buy a new graphics card., The result is a game that can be played on most anything even remotely modern., You need windows 7, a 2.6-GHz Pentium IV, and a 128MB PCIe Nvidia GeForce 6600 GT or ATI Radeon 9800 Pro video card (or better)., That's pretty reasonable., If you want to see if your computer can handle StarCraft II, the StarCraft II Web site for tech specs., StarCraft II's iconic soundtrack is a big draw, which was also the case with the original release., The fine musical balance helps create mood., For example, while you're sitting in the Cantina watching the UNN news, you'll hear the jukebox playing an old, twangy western song, "Zerg, Shotgun, and You." In another instance, a space-cowboy melody reminiscent of shows like Firefly and Cowboy Bebop provide the musical backdrop., Lasting Appeal
When not being beaten down by South Koreans in the multiplayer mode (the game is massively popular in South Korea), I discovered that StarCraft II's online multiplayer modes add replayability, making the game well worth the $59.99 price tag., StarCraft II's multiplayer options let you duke it out against the CPU, or human beings in up to four-versus-four matches., There are also the four difficulty levels, and achievements to entice completionists., StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is everything I hoped it would be., Nothing could quite live up to the hype surrounding the release, but, even so, this is a great game., The story's well paced, and the strategy and resource-management missions locked me into finishing this game., I can only hope that we won't have to wait another 12 years for the next chapter in this excellent series., Posted by Chief on Jul 26, 2010
