"Windows 7 gets the basics right"
"Here's what you need to know about the new OS.By Harry McCrackenOct 19, 2009 1:00 pmWhat if a new version of Windows didn't try to dazzle you"
"What if, instead, it tried to disappear except when you needed it"
"Such an operating system would dispense with glitzy effects in favor of low-key, useful new features"
"Rather than pelting you with alerts, warnings, and requests, it would try to stay out of your face"
"And if any bundled applications weren't essential, it would dump 'em.It's not a what-if scenario"
"Windows 7, set to arrive on new PCs and as a shrinkwrapped upgrade on October 22, has a minimalist feel and attempts to fix an noyances old and new"
"In contrast, Windows Vista offered a flashy new interface, but its poor performance, compatibility gotchas, and lack of compelling features made some folks regret upgrading and others refuse to leave Windows XP.Windows 7 is hardly flawless"
"Some features feel unfinished; others won't realize their potential without heavy lifting by third parties"
"And some long-standing annoyances remain intact"
"But overall, the final shipping version I test-drove appears to be the worthy successor to Windows XP that Vista never was.Microsoft's release of Windows 7 also roughly coincides with Apple's release of its new Snow Leopard; for a visual comparison of the two operating systems, see our slideshow "Snow Leopard Versus Windows 7." Of course, an OS can't be a winner if it turns a zippy PC into a slowpoke or causes installation nightmares"
"Consult "Windows 7 Performance Tests" for Windows 7 performance test results, and "How to Upgrade to Windows 7" for hands-on advice on the best way to install it"
"Read on here for an in-depth look at how Microsoft has changed its OS--mostly for the better--in Windows 7.Interface: The New TaskmasterThe Windows experience occurs mainly in its Taskbar--especially in the Start menu and System Tray"
"Vista gave the Start menu a welcome redesign; in Windows 7, the Taskbar and the System Tray get a thorough makeover.Windows 7's revamped Taskbar introduces several new features and gives users much more control over how it looks.The new Taskbar replaces the old small icons and text labels for running apps with larger, unlabeled icons"
"If you can keep the icons straight, the new design painlessly reduces Taskbar clutter"
"If you don't like it, you can shrink the icons and/or bring the labels back.In the past, you could get one-click access to programs by dragging their icons to the Quick Launch toolbar"
"Windows 7 eliminates Quick Launch and folds its capabilities into the Taskbar"
"Drag an app's icon from the Start menu or desktop to the Taskbar, and Windows will pin it there, so you can launch the program without rummaging around in the Start menu"
"You can also organize icons in the Taskbar by moving them to new positions.To indicate that a particular application on the Taskbar is running, Windows draws a subtle box around its icon--so subtle, in fact, that figuring out whether the app is running can take a moment, especially if its icon sits between two icons for running apps.In Windows Vista, hovering the mouse pointer over an application's Taskbar icon produces a thumbnail window view known as a Live Preview"
"But when you have multiple windows open, you see only one preview at a time"
"Windows 7's version of this feature is slicker and more efficient: Hover the pointer on an icon, and thumbnails of the app's windows glide into position above the Taskbar, so you can quickly find the one you're looking for"
"(The process would be even simpler if the thumbnails were larger and easier to decipher.)Also new in Windows 7's Taskbar is a feature called Jump Lists"
"These menus resemble the context-sensitive ones you get when you right-click within various Windows applications, except that you don't have to be inside an app to use them"
"Internet Explorer 8's Jump List, for example, lets you open the browser and load a fresh tab, initiate an InPrivate stealth browsing session, or go directly to any of eight frequently visited Web pages"
"Non-Microsoft apps can offer Jump Lists, too, if their developers follow the guidelines for creating them.Other Windows 7 interface adjustments are minor, yet so sensible that you may wonder why Windows didn't include them all along"
"Shove a window into the left or right edge of the screen and it'll expand to fill half of your desktop"
"Nudge another into the opposite edge of the screen, and it'll expand to occupy the other half"
"That makes comparing two windows' contents easy"
"If you nudge a window into the top of the screen, it will maximize to occupy all of the display's real estate.The extreme right edge of the Taskbar now sports a sort of nub; hover over it, and open windows become transparent, revealing the desktop below"
"(Microsoft calls this feature Aero Peek.) Click the nub, and the windows scoot out of the way, giving you access to documents or apps that reside on the desktop and duplicating the Show Desktop feature that Quick Launch used to offer.Getting at your desktop may soon be come even more important than it was in the past"
"That's because Windows 7 does away with the Sidebar, the portion of screen space that Windows Vista reserved for Gadgets such as a photo viewer and a weather applet"
"Instead of occupying the Sidebar, Gadgets now sit directly on the desktop, where they don't compete with other apps for precious screen real estate.Old Tray, New Tricks: Windows 7's Taskbar and window management tweaks are nice"
"But its changes to the System Tray--aka the Notification Area--have a huge positive effect.Changes in Windows 7 transform the System Tray from an intrusive eyesore (in Windows Vista) into a useful set of shortcuts and other controls.In the past, no feature of Windows packed more frustration per square inch than the System Tray"
"It quickly grew dense with applets that users did not want in the first place, and many of the uninvited guests employed word balloons and other intrusive methods to alert users to uninteresting facts at inopportune moments"
"At their worst, System Tray applets behaved like belligerent squatters, and Windows did little to put users back in charge.In Windows 7, applets can't pester you unbidden because software installers can't dump them into the System Tray"
"Instead, applets land in a holding pen that appears only when you click it, a much-improved version of the overflow area used in previous incarnations of the Tray"
"App lets in the pen can't float word balloons at you unless you permit them to do so"
"It's a cinch to drag them into the System Tray or out of it again, so you enjoy complete control over which applets reside there.More good news: Windows 7 largely dispenses with the onslaught of word-balloon warnings from the OS about troubleshooting issues, potential security problems, and the like"
"A new area called Action Center--a revamped version of Vista's Security Center--queues up such alerts so you can deal with them at your convenience"
"Action Center does issue notifications of its own from the System Tray, but you can shut these off if you don't want them pestering you.All of this helps make Windows 7 the least distracting, least intrusive Microsoft OS in a very long time"
"It's a giant step forward from the days when Windows thought nothing of interrupting your work to inform you that it had de tected unused icons on your desktop.File Management: The Library SystemCompared to the Taskbar and the System Tray, Explorer hasn't changed much in Windows 7"
"However, its left pane does sport two new ways to get at your files: Libraries and HomeGroups.Libraries could just as appropriately have been called File Cabinets, since they let you collect related folders in one place"
"By default, you get Libraries labeled Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos, each of which initially di rects you to the OS's standard folders for storing the named items--such as My Pictures and Public Pictures.To benefit from Libraries, you have to customize them"
"Right-click any folder on your hard drive, and you can add it to any Library; for instance, you can transform the Pictures Library into a collection of all your folders that contain photos"
"You can create additional Libraries of your own from scratch, such as one that bundles up all folders that relate to your vacation plans.Libraries would be even more useful if Microsoft had integrated them with Saved Searches, the Windows feature (introduced in Vista) that lets you create virtual folders based on searches, such as one that tracks down every .jpg image file on your system"
"But while Windows 7 lets you add standard folders to a Library, it doesn't support Saved Searches.HomeGroups, Swee HomeGroups"
"Closely related to Libraries are HomeGroups, a new feature designed to simplify the notoriously tricky process of networking Windows PCs"
"Machines that are part of one HomeGroup can selectively grant each other read or read/write access to their Libraries and to the folders they contain, so you can perform such mundane but important tasks as providing your spouse with ac cess to a folderful of tax documents on your computer"
"HomeGroups can also stream media, enabling you to pipe music or a movie off the desktop in the den onto your notebook in the living room"
"And they let you share a printer connected to one PC with all the other computers in the HomeGroup, a useful feature if you can't connect the printer directly to the network.HomeGroups aren't a bad idea, but Windows 7's implementation seems half-baked"
"HomeGroups are password-protected, but rather than inviting you to specify a password of your choice during initial setup, Windows assigns you one consisting of ten characters of alphanumeric gibberish and instructs you to write it down so you won't forget it"
"To be fair, passwords made up of random characters provide excellent security, and the only time you need the password is when you first connect a new PC to a HomeGroup"
"But it's still a tad peculiar that you can't specify a password you'll remember during setup--you can do that only after the fact, in a different part of the OS"
"More annoying and limiting: HomeGroups won't work unless all of the PCs in question are running Windows 7, a scenario that won't be typical anytime soon"
"A version that also worked on XP, Vista, and Mac systems would have been cooler.Federated Search, a new Windows Explorer feature, feels incomplete, too"
"It uses the Open Search standard to give Win 7's search "connectors" for external sources"
"That capability allows you to search sites such as Flickr and YouTube from within Explorer"
"Pretty neat--except that Windows 7 doesn't come with any of the connectors you'd need to add these sources, nor with any way of finding them"
"(They are available on the Web, though"
"Use a search engine to track them down.)Security: UAC Gets TolerableSpeaking of annoying Windows features, let's talk about User Account Control--the Windows Vista security element that was a poster child for everything that rankled people about that OS"
"UAC aimed to prevent rogue software from tampering with your PC by endlessly prompting you to approve running applications or changing settings"
"The experience was so grating that many users preferred to turn UAC off and take their chances with Internet attackers"
"Those who left it active risked slipping into the habit of incautiously clicking through every prompt, defeating whatever value the feature might have had.Whereas Vista's notorious User Account Control gave users no control over the feature other than to turn it off, Windows 7's version of UAC lets users choose from two intermediate notification levels between 'Always notify' and 'Never notify'.Windows 7 gives you control over UAC, in the form of a slider containing four security settings"
"As before, you can accept the full-blown UAC or elect to disable it"
"But you can also tell UAC to notify you only when software changes Windows settings, not when you're tweaking them yourself"
"And you can instruct it not to perform the abrupt screen-dimming effect that Vista's version uses to grab your attention.If Microsoft had its druthers, all Windows 7 users would use UAC in full-tilt mode: The slider that you use to ratchet back its severity advises you not to do so if you routinely install new software or visit unfamiliar sites, and it warns that disabling the dimming effect is "Not recommended." Speak for yourself, Redmond: I have every intention of recommending the intermediate settings to most people who ask me for advice, since those settings retain most of UAC's theoretical value without driving users bonkers.Other than salvaging UAC, Microsoft has made relatively few significant changes to Windows 7's security system"
"One meaningful improvement: BitLocker, the drive-encryption tool included only in Windows 7 Ultimate and the corporate-oriented Windows 7 Enterprise, lets you en crypt USB drives and hard disks, courtesy of a feature called BitLocker to Go"
"It's one of the few good reasons to prefer Win 7 Ultimate to Home Premium or Professional.Internet Explorer 8, Windows 7's de fault browser, includes many security-related enhancements, including a new SmartScreen Filter (which blocks dangerous Web sites) and InPrivate Browsing (which permits you to use IE without leaving traces of where you've been or what you've done)"
"Of course, IE 8 is equally at home in XP and Vista--and it's free--so it doesn't constitute a reason to upgrade to Windows 7.Applications: The Fewer the MerrierHere's a startling indication of how different an upgrade Windows 7 is: Rather than larding it up with new applications, Microsoft eliminated three nonessential programs: Windows Mail (nÃ©e Outlook Express), Windows Movie Maker (which premiered in Windows Me), and Windows Photo Gallery.Users who don't want to give them up can find all three at live.windows.com as free Windows Live Essentials downloads"
"They may even come with your new PC, courtesy of deals Microsoft is striking with PC manufacturers"
"But since they are no longer tied to the leisurely release schedules of Windows, they are far less likely than most bundled Windows apps to remain mired in definitely in an underachieving state.Still present--and nicely spruced up--are the operating system's two applications for consuming audio and video, Windows Media Player and Windows Media Center"
"Windows Media Player 12 has a revised interface that divides operations into a Library view for media management and a Now Playing view for listening and watching stuff"
"Minimize the player into the Taskbar, and you get mini player controls and a Jump List, both of which let you control background music without having to leave the app you're in"
"Microsoft has added support for several media types that Media Player 11 didn't support, including AAC audio and H.264 video--the formats it needs to play unprotected music and movies from Apple's iTunes Store.Media Center--not part of the bargain-basement Windows 7 Starter Edition--remains most useful if you have a PC configured with a TV tuner card and you use your computer to record TV shows Ã  la TiVo"
"Among its enhancements are a better program guide and support for more tuners.The Backup and Restore Center in Windows 7 gives users greater specificity in selecting files to back up than Vista did, but most versions of Win 7 can't back up to a network drive.Windows Vista's oddly underpowered Backup and Restore Center let users specify particular types of files to back up (such as â€˜Music' and â€˜Documents') but not specific files or folders"
"Though Microsoft corrects that deficiency in Windows 7, it deprives Windows 7 Starter Edition and Home Premium of the ability to back up to a network drive"
"That feels chintzy, like a car company cutting back on an economy sedan's airbags"
"It also continues the company's long streak of issuing versions of Windows that lack a truly satisfying backup utility.The new version of Paint has Office 2007's Ribbon toolbar and adds various prefabricated geometric shapes and a few natural-media tools, such as a watercolor brush"
"But my regimen for preparing a new Windows PC for use will still include installing the impressive free image editor Paint.Net.The nearest thing Windows 7 has to a major new application has the intriguing moniker Windows XP Mode"
"It's not a way to make Windows 7 look like XP--you can do that with the Windows Classic theme--but rather a way to let it run XP programs that are otherwise incompatible with Win 7"
"Unfortunately, only Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate offer it, and even then it comes as an optional 350MB download that requires you to have Microsoft's free Virtual PC software installed and that only works on PCs with Intel or AMD virtualization technology enabled in the BIOS.Once active, XP Mode lets Windows 7 run apps that supposedly aren't compatible by launching them in separate windows that contain a virtualized version of XP"
"Microsoft clearly means for the mode to serve as a security blanket for business types who rely on ancient, often proprietary programs that may never be rewritten for current OSs.Device Management: Setting the StageWindows 7 offers you numerous ways to connect your PC to everything from tiny flash drives to hulking networked laser printers--USB, Wi-Fi, ethernet, slots, and more"
"Devices and Printers, a new section of the Control Panel, represents connected gadgets with the largest icons I've ever seen in an operating system"
"(When possible, they're 3D renderings of the device; the one for Sansa's Clip MP3 player is almost life-size.)More important, the OS introduces Device Stages--hardware-wrangling dashboards tailored to specific items of hardware, and designed by their manufacturers in collaboration with Micro soft"
"A Device Stage for a digital camera, for instance, may include a battery gauge, a shortcut to Windows' image-downloading tools, and links to online resources such as manuals, support sites, and the manufacturer's accessory store.You don't need to rummage through the Control Panel or through Devices and Printers to use a Device Stage--that feature's functionality is integrated into Windows 7's new Taskbar"
"Plug in a device, and it will show up as a Taskbar icon; right-click that icon, and the Device Stage's content will at once ap pear as a Jump List-like menu.Unfortunately, Device Stages were the one major part of Windows 7 that didn't work during my hands-on time with the final version of the OS"
"Earlier prerelease versions of Win 7 contained a handful of Device Stages, but Microsoft disabled them so that hardware manufacturers could finish up final ones before the OS hit store shelves in October"
"The feature will be a welcome improvement if device manufacturers hop on the bandwagon--and a major disappointment if they don't.Even if Device Stages take off, most of their benefit may come as you invest in new gizmos--Microsoft says that it's encouraging manufacturers to create Device Stages for upcoming products, not existing ones"
"At least some older products should get Device Stages, though: Canon, for instance, told me that it's planning to build them for most of its printers"
"And Microsoft says that when no full-fledged Device Stage is available for a particular item, Windows 7 will still try to give you a more generic and basic one.Input: Reach Out and Touch Windows 7Microsoftâ€™s Collage tool shows off the power of touch-based input to good effect.The biggest user interface trend since Windows Vista shipped in January 2007 is touchscreen input; Windows 7 is the first version of the OS to offer built-in multitouch support (see "Windows 7 Hardware: Touch Finally Arrives").Windows 7's new touch features are subtle on a touch-capable PC and invisible otherwise"
"Swipe your finger up or down to scroll through document files and Web pages; sweep two fingers back and forth to zoom in and out"
"Dragging up on icons in the Taskbar reveals Win 7's new Jump Lists"
"The Taskbar button that reveals the Windows desktop is a bit bigger on touch PCs for easier use.I installed the final version of Windows 7 and beta touchscreen drivers on an HP TouchSmart all-in-one PC"
"The touch features worked as advertised"
"But applications written with touch as the primary interface will determine whether touch becomes useful and ubiquitous"
"Until they arrive, Windows will continue to feel like an OS built chiefly for use with a keyboard and mouse--which it is.You might have expected Microsoft to reinvent familiar tools such as Paint and Media Player for touch input"
"But the closest it comes to that is with the Windows 7 Touch Pack, a set of six touch-based programs, including a version of Virtual Earth that you can explore with your finger, and an app that lets you assemble photo collages"
"The Touch Pack isn't part of Windows 7, but it will ship with some Win 7 PCs, and it's a blast to play with.Still, ultimately, the Pack is just a sexy demo of the interface's potential, not an argument for buying a touch computer today"
"Third-party software developers won't start writing touch-centric apps in force until a critical mass of PCs can run them"
"That should happen in the months following Windows 7's release, as finger-ready machines from Asus, Lenovo, Sony, and other manufacturers join those from HP and Dell"
"And even then, touch input may not become commonplace on Windows 7 PCs"
"But if a killer touch app is out there waiting to be written, we may know soon enough.Bottom Line: Is Windows 7 Worth It?Reading about a new operating system can tell you only so much about it: After all, Windows Vista had far more features than XP, yet fell far short of it in the eyes of many users"
"To judge an OS accurately, you have to live with it.Over the past ten months, I've spent a substantial percentage of my computing life in Windows 7, starting with a preliminary version and culminating in recent weeks with the final Release to Manufacturing edition"
"I've run it on systems ranging from an underpowered Asus EeePC 1000HE netbook to a po tent HP TouchSmart all-in-one"
"And I've used it to do real work, not lab routines.Usually, I've run the OS in multiboot configurations with Windows Vista and/or XP, so I've had a choice each time I turned the computer on: Should I opt for Windows 7 or an older version of the OS"
"The call has been easy to make, because Win 7 is so pleasant to use.So why wouldn't you want to run this operating system"
"Concern over its performance is one logical reason, especially since early versions of Windows Vista managed to turn PCs that ran XP with ease into lethargic underperformers"
"The PC World Test Center's speed benchmarks on five test PCs showed Windows 7 to be faster than Vista, but only by a little; I've found it to be reasonably quick on every computer I've used it on--even the Asus netbook, once I upgraded it to 2GB of RAM"
"(Our lab tried Win 7 on a Lenovo S10 netbook with 1GB of RAM and found it to be a shade slower than XP; for details see "Windows 7 Performance Tests.")Here's a rule of thumb that errs on the side of caution: If your PC's specs qualify it to run Vista, get Windows 7; if they aren't, avoid it"
"Microsoft's official hardware configuration requirements for Windows 7 are nearly identical to those it recommends for Windows Vista: a 1-GHz CPU, 1GB of RAM, 16GB of free disk space, and a DirectX 9-compatible graphics device with a WDDM 1.0 or higher driver"
"That's for the 32-bit version of Windows 7; the 64-bit version of the OS requires a 64-bit CPU, 2GB of RAM, and 20GB of disk space.Fear of incompatible hardware and software is another understandable reason to be wary of Windows 7"
"One un fortunate law of operating-system upgrades--which applies equally to Macs and to Windows PCs--is that they will break some systems and applications, especially at first.Under the hood, Windows 7 isn't radically different from Vista"
"That's a plus, since it should greatly reduce the volume of difficulties relating to drivers and apps compared to Vista's bumpy rollout"
"I have performed a half-dozen Windows 7 upgrades, and most of them went off without a hitch"
"The gnarliest problem arose when I had to track down a graphics driver for Dell's XPS M1330 laptop on my own--Windows 7 installed a generic VGA driver that couldn't run the Aero user interface, and as a result failed to support new Windows 7 features such as thumbnail views in the Taskbar.The best way to reduce your odds of running into a showstopping problem with Windows 7 is to bide your time"
"When the new operating system arrives on October 22, sit back and let the earliest adopters discover the worst snafus"
"Within a few weeks, Microsoft and other software and hardware companies will have fixed most of them, and your chances of a happy migration to Win 7 will be much higher"
"If you want to be really conservative, hold off on moving to Win 7 until you're ready to buy a PC that's designed to run it well.Waiting a bit before making the leap makes sense; waiting forever does not"
"Microsoft took far too long to come up with a satisfactory replacement for Windows XP"
"But whether you choose to install Windows 7 on your current systems or get it on the next new PC you buy, you'll find that it's the unassuming, thoroughly practical upgrade you've been waiting for--flaws and all.Itâ€™s finally here"
"Nearly three years after Microsoft unleashed Windows Vista unto the world, crippling otherwise competent computers with obscene system requirements and feature bloat, Microsoft has returned for redemption with Windows 7, otherwise known as â€œwhat Vista should have been.â€? Though not as revolutionary in appearance as its predecessor, Microsoft has promised a slew of long-awaited refinements, including better performance, a powerful universal search, and better driver and hardware compatibility"
"We popped our freshly minted RTM copy of Windows 7 into the favorite office testbed â€“ HPâ€™s Firebird â€“ and put the new OS through its paces to see whether Redmond can deliver on its promises when Windows 7 hits the streets on October 22.Check out our Window 7 video review.InstallationNot surprisingly, the installer for Windows 7 looks uncannily like Windows Vistaâ€™s: pop in the disc, navigate through a few questions about where you want it installed, then let it grind out the rest"
"Amazingly, it took only 17 minutes after finishing up the brief question period to landing on the Windows 7 desktop â€“ a pretty impressive feat.After launching for the very first time, Windows 7 transparently dealt with all our Firebirdâ€™s hardware except the video card, which we had to right click on under device manager and ask it to pull new drivers for"
"After a short automated search and install process, we had month-old drivers on the machine without so much as having to open a browser â€“ though we did find slightly fresher drivers on Nvidiaâ€™s site.The New DesktopWhile Windows 7 retains the same glassy window style, icons and many other holdovers from Vista, more users will immediately notice that the taskbar has changed dramatically"
"Most notably, Microsoft has stripped out the clutter"
"A slightly taller taskbar now accommodates large, squared-off icons (rather than rectangular labels) in the bar, making it in some ways similar to Macâ€™s OS X dock"
"Every open program gets an icon, but you can also pin your favorites to hang out on the bottom even when theyâ€™re not in use, similar to the quick-launch area in previous Windows"
"This helps reduce the visual untidiness that comes from stringing out program titles in the taskbar itself"
"And really who needs them"
"If you do decide to revert to the old ways, Windows 7 will allow you to turn off the icon-based system, and also shrink the taskbar back to its original size.New and improved Windows 7 taskbarSince icons alone donâ€™t tell you whatâ€™s going on with your desktop at any given time, Microsoft has implemented its new Aero Peek feature to fill in the necessary details"
"Hovering over any icon (or clicking if youâ€™re in a hurry) will show the separate thumbnails for each window within any given program, like different Firefox windows, along with labels (Yahoo, Digg, Downloads, etc.) above them"
"Hovering over a thumbnail will take the details a step further by hiding every window and showing just the one in question to clarify which youâ€™re dealing with"
"You can also right-click on any of the taskbar icons to get Jump Lists, which are basically shortcut lists pertaining to the programs"
"For instance, IE will present shortcuts for your last visited sites and tasks, like opening a new tab, while Windows Media player will let you pause or skip forward through playlists without actually opening it to full screen.Hover over any icon to view thumbnailsWith many users now sporting enormous widescreen monitors, Windows 7â€™s new â€œsnapsâ€? feature turned out to be one of the most unexpectedly smart additions to make the most of all that real estate"
"Grab any window, drag it to the right or left edge of the screen, and it will automatically resize to half the screen"
"This makes it easy to browse on two screens at once to compare, type in Word with a browser window next to it, and so on"
"When youâ€™re done, dragging the window to a new position automatically returns it to the old size"
"Additional options for snapping (akin to those the freeware AllSnap offers) would still be appreciated, though.Windows 7 new snap featureFor those who immediately look at a Windows desktop and want to get to work making it their own, Microsoft has made that easier, as well"
"The new personalization menu features a wide array of attractive built-in themes, plus the means to switch them up by swapping backgrounds, screensavers, and even picking a custom color from a mixer for menus and using a slider to determine its opacity"
"This isnâ€™t quite a WindowBlinds level of customization, but itâ€™s easy, and 99 percent of users will probably be thrilled with the results.Windows 7 personalization optionsA revamped device management window takes much of the confusion out of connecting new gadgets"
"Simple devices like hard drives, thumb drives and webcams will mostly be automatically detected, and show up under this pane alongside other connected items like mice, keyboards and Wi-Fi adapters"
"Although we didnâ€™t witness it in our demo, manufacturers will also be able to customize the windows with specific images and custom interfaces.Google-Caliber Desktop SearchThe new global search feature will undoubtedly become the new userâ€™s best friend"
"Itâ€™s available as soon as you open the start menu (which otherwise exactly replicates Vistaâ€™s) and churns up results as soon as you start pouring in text, letter-by-letter"
"It most obviously eliminates the need to use deeply buried shortcuts â€“ just type â€œphotoshopâ€? and youâ€™re there â€“ but because it searches so deeply, we found it even more useful elsewhere"
"For instance, we uncovered OS options much faster with search than by manually combing for them"
"Want to know how to customize the taskbar"
"Just type â€œtaskbarâ€? and the relevant control panel options all pop up in an instant â€“ no need to root around looking for just the one want"
"Those with an aversion to keyboards can still click their way to what they need, but a little prudent searching removes a lot of bumbling around.Windows 7 desktop searchPerformanceThough an impressive basket of extras went a long way in smoothing over our Vista misgivings, the real test came when we broke out the stopwatch and measured frame rates"
"After all, bells and whistles donâ€™t go very far when they slow your computer to an unbearable chug"
"(Weâ€™ve learned that, right Microsoft?)On paper, you wouldnâ€™t really expect any major difference, based on the system requirements"
"Both Windows 7 and Vista demand a 1GHz processor, 1GB of memory, and the required hard drive space has swelled from 15GB to 16GB"
"That said, needing the same hardware can be considered progress when computers continue to get faster and cheaper every day"
"Any new machine on the market today should be able to handle Windows 7.Racing both operating systems against each other on boot-up times proved that system requirements donâ€™t mean everything"
"Windows 7 took us from our dual-boot menu to a working browser window opened on the desktop in 45 seconds"
"Vista did it in one minute and five seconds"
"Thatâ€™s some significant progress.Though we donâ€™t have an actual metric to prove it, we can also attest â€“ based on the impression of every DT editor who tried Windows 7 â€“ that it definitely feels faster"
"Windows open and close quicker, menus snap open without delay, and that dreaded spinning wheel of blue that indicates the system is busy has been all but banished.Game TimeOf course, the real test for Microsoft will be winning over gamers, an audience that almost universally shunned Vista for its negative impact on performance"
"When youâ€™re dealing with audience willing to rip open their computers and cool them with water for an extra ounce of performance, all the glassy windows and widgets in the world just donâ€™t matter.And they wonâ€™t be disappointed this time around"
"Microsoft has vastly improved gaming performance with Windows 7"
"As youâ€™ll recall from our HP Firebird review, the machine seemed to struggle with both MotoGP and Crysis at 1080p resolution when running Vista"
"Both games were technically playable, but in both cases we had to trim back other settings to get the smooth frame rates that make games enjoyable and fun to play.Running the same games on Windows 7, we encountered no such issues"
"Same system, same games, same settings â€“ no stutter"
"The big firefights that brought the Firebird to its knees in Crysis went over without issue, and MotoGP 08 played â€“ with all settings maxed out â€“ without a hiccup"
"Benchmarks didnâ€™t really seem to bear out any improvement, though"
"Running 3DMark06 produced a score of 12,266 3DMarks, which is incredibly close to our original 12,297 from Vista"
"But we know a difference when we play it.The Junker TestWindows Vista notoriously strangled older PCs, but with the reputation for performance Windows 7 had started to garner, we couldnâ€™t help but test it on the same aging, nearly-broken laptop we turned into a home media server"
"With a Pentium 4 processor and paltry 512MB of RAM, it wasnâ€™t even technically over the minimum requirements, but we went ahead and pushed anyway"
"After installing new firmware for the DVD drive to get it to load, it miraculously worked"
"Unfortunately, itâ€™s no substitute for Windows XP"
"Where XP could go from power button to desktop in 30 seconds on this machine, Windows 7 hit a much longer one minute and 23 seconds"
"It also seemed a bit more sluggish on the desktop, but to be fair, just idling ate up 44 percent of our RAM, so a rather inexpensive memory upgrade would probably improve performance significantly"
"We also have to give it credit for finding most of the drivers we needed on its own, including some notoriously finicky ones for an old Linksys PCMCIA card"
"Gamers need not apply, but for surfing, typing, and some light Solitaire, it actually worked"
"Will Windows 7 replace XP as the OS of choice on aging computers"
"Probably not"
"Will it work in a pinch, even on machines that shouldnâ€™t even be able to run it"
"Unlike Vista, that answer is yes.Dell Inspiron 5150 junker running Windows 7Still a Few HiccupsDespite otherwise shining experience with Windows 7, we do feel obliged to report a few zingers it sent us during our days of testing"
"After changing themes, for instance, we found that the taskbar icons no longer worked until we reopened the windows"
"We also had Launcher.exe crash the first time we ran MotoGP 08, and some older software forced us out of Aero mode and into Windows Basic mode since it lacked support for it"
"So it goes"
"These are all minor inconveniences, and none of them significantly diminished our experience, or held us up from accomplishing anything important"
"Our biggest hang-up actually came from the wireless mouse included with HPâ€™s Firebird, which sporadically stopped working every 10 minutes until we turned it off and on again.ConclusionWith OS X Snow Leopard, innumerable different flavors of Linux and now Googleâ€™s own ChromeOS lining up to challenge Microsoftâ€™s superiority in operating systems, its stranglehold on the market has never seemed more precarious"
"But let Windows 7 lay rumors of an OS coup dâ€™Ã©tat to rest"
"Like an old fascist dictator, Vista is officially dead and buried, and its successor is one you can actually warm up to"
"Microsoft has not only atoned for Vistaâ€™s grievances with vastly improved performance and fewer nags, a number of old standbys that no one was complaining about (like the task bar) have been reimagined and made better at the same time.Pros:Painless installationQuick boot timesReimagined, clutter-free taskbarVastly superior gaming performanceCons:Some users will still crave more customizationWindows XP still outshines on older systemsOh, Windows"
"You inform and entertain us"
"You are inescapable, and your Start menu is full of items relevant to our productivity"
"You move us"
"Sort of"
"To be honest, we're not sure what sort of state this fair planet of ours would be in without the ruggedly functional operating systems the folks at Redmond have handed to us over the years, and while Windows Vista might have proved that Microsoft wasn't invincible, it did nothing to demonstrate that Windows as an idea -- and for most, a necessity -- was at all in jeopardy.Windows 7 arrives on the scene three short years after Vista, shoring up its predecessor's inadequacies and perhaps offering a little bit more to chew on"
"We've been playing with the OS ever since the beta, along through the release candidate, and now at last have the final, "release to manufacturing" (RTM) edition in our grubby paws"
"Does it live up to its understandable hype and the implicit expectations of a major Microsoft release"
"Let's proceed on a magical journey to discover the truth for ourselves.Install / boot times / shutdownIt's the most base of operating system functions"
"Install, turn on, turn off"
"But first impressions matter, and Microsoft made sure to give Windows 7 a nice sheen when it came to these things"
"You can read through our full installation guide for an in-depth look at the pitfalls and triumphs of Windows 7 in this department, but in short: it's fast and lightweight, but the real performance gains can be found on netbooks and with clean installs"
"Otherwise there's really nothing to put Vista to shame -- though the amazing breath of fresh air a clean install provides should really set cruftware-happy vendors to a bit of soul searching.UI enhancementsSince Windows 7 is a sort of streamlined Vista underneath -- same hardware requirements, same hardware compatibility model, a bit less cruft -- you'll have to look to the basic UI for Microsoft's most visible additions to the OS"
"Makes sense, we suppose"
"Here are some of the highlights:Aero PeekEverybody who's used a modern operating system for more than five minutes has been met with the hassle of juggling too many windows, and Aero Peek seeks to alleviate some of that"
"Available with any machine capable of "fancy mode" translucent window graphics, Aero Peek lets you hover over a "show desktop" field in the right of the task bar and show the outlines of every window currently open -- which usually amounts to chaos.More helpful, however, is the ability to hover over the fly-out thumbnails that pop up from the taskbar app groupings, and isolate that specific window while all other windows are sent to outline mode"
"It serves as both geography lesson and a rapid navigation method, without feeling as clunky or "all-or-nothing" as previous attempts at windows management in Windows"
"Check out the video demo below to see how this plays out in practice:Aero Shake What we first thought was merely a gimmick has become one of our favorite features: merely grab the titlebar of a window and give it a vigorous shake to minimize all other windows"
"Great when you're changing tasks and want to rid yourself of the clutter of your previous activities, and we hardly know how we've made it so far in life without it.Start Menu Mac OS X might have Spotlight, but Windows now has great instant search as well, and the Windows key has a new lease on life"
"Merely pop open the Start Menu and start typing and search results start populating"
"It's not nearly as comprehensive as Spotlight, but it also doesn't seem to be faced with the same slowdowns of its Mac OS X counterpart, and typically tracks down what we're looking for (apps, usually)"
"The Start Menu has also been enhanced with a refined layout and supplemental menus for frequently used items -- offering access to recent items used by that application, along with the new "tasks" list that Microsoft has snuck into the OS, but which are currently only used by a few Microsoft-built apps"
"Aero SnapPerhaps our favorite day-to-day improvement of them all, Aero Snap offers a surprisingly smart way of working with windows, using the mere power of a click and drag"
"Windows can be maximized by being pulled to the top of the screen, or set to fill one half of the screen by being dragging to the far left or right edge of the screen"
"An Aero Peek-style outline lets you preview what you're doing, and it's easy enough to bounce away from the "sticky" edges, or pull an already maximized window away from its moorings"
"Windows Key + Left Arrow or Right Arrow accomplishes the same thing for filling one half of the screen with the current window, and is perfect for lining up document comparisons"
"New TaskbarThis one gets all the press, but it's really more a product of Aero Peek than anything clever in and of itself"
"Basically it takes some ideas from the Mac OS X dock like larger icons and app launcher duties (icons can be "pinned" to remain in place whether the application is open or not, a melding of Windows' old Quick Launch Bar into the taskbar proper), and adds in traditional Windows taskbar activity like the listing of open windows"
"The default functionality is fine, which keeps everything "stacked" in its respective icon, but the real money is in the "combine when taskbar is full" view, which can be accessed from the taskbar properties"
"This brings the benefits of verbose item names -- always a big win for Windows over Mac OS's icons-only approach -- without sacrificing the fancy Aero Peek features or the pretty icons"
"What's not so elegant is how hidden icons in the far-right system tray are now housed in an ugly little pop-up menu.Even worse is the fact that dragging a file to an app icon in the taskbar doesn't allow you to open that file with the app, but instead asks if you want to "pin" the file to that app"
"Newsflash: we'd rather not"
"With a bit of work you can re-add the old fashioned Quick Launch set of mini-icons for drag and dropability, but that's pretty silly"
"We're glad there's enough customization available to make this livable, but we'd say Microsoft could have done a better job of thinking through its defaults.Quick display switching Windows + P = magic"
"Really, it's the little things that count, and Microsoft has made managing multiple displays and switching between commonly used configurations a total snap.UI stayed-the-samesMicrosoft got a lot right with its new UI tweaks, but it certainly could've taken things a few logical steps further"
"For instance, it's odd that there's no built-in support of multifinger trackpad gestures -- why is this something that third party vendors have to figure out all by themselves"
"We understand that the hardware isn't universal, but we'd like to see Microsoft driving the adoption of such functionality by building clear, reliable support for it into the OS"
"Two finger scroll in particular: it's the best thing to happen to trackpads since tap-to-click, and we think everybody should've figured that out by now"
"On the multitouch front, Windows 7's support for multitouch display interaction is laudable but hardly sufficient"
"Microsoft itself has poured plenty of R&D into finger-friendly interfaces, and we would hope that they'd be building some of that innovation into the OS by now -- the release of the Surface-inspired Microsoft Touch Pack is a nice start, but doesn't go far enough"
"We shudder to imagine the haphazard implementations of smartphone-style multitouch innovations we're undoubtedly going to be seeing from OEMs in the coming years.Overall, Microsoft has failed to establish a cohesive styling and operation model to its own applications, which range from the relatively new "ribbon" toolbars of Office, (and now WordPad, above, and Paint), to the website-like Control Panel navigation, to the ancient Device Manager trees, to the tabbed properties panes, and so on"
"In an attempt to simplify many of its interfaces, frequently used actions have been slowly popping up as buttons where menu bars used to be, while the deep functionality of "true" menus has been hidden elsewhere in the interface"
"All of this wouldn't be so horrible if Microsoft was the only builder of applications for Windows, but given thousands and thousands of developers out there making widely disparate application interfaces for Windows, we'd really appreciate it if Microsoft took a bit more leadership and more clearly defined a UI design language that was consistent and useful for users"
"Notable app changesWindows Media Center"
"We've gone way in-depth on this over at Engadget HD, but suffice it to say that Windows Media Center in Windows 7 is vastly superior to Windows Vista's version, and most all of the bugs from the Windows 7 beta seem to be ironed out quite nicely"
"The interface is a real treat, the extender functionality to the Xbox 360 and 3rd party boxes is much improved and quite snappier, and a truly marvelous amount of hardware is supported"
"Windows Media Player It's pretty much Windows Media Player, you know"
"The good news is that Microsoft has greatly expanded the codec support, to something bordering on comprehensive:Pulled from Microsoft's Engineering Windows 7 blogWhat's even more fun is the new "Play to" function, which can beam a locally-controlled audio playlist to computers that are part of your HomeGroup, DLNA devices like the PS3, or Media Center Extenders like the Xbox 360"
"Remotely shared libraries are also automatically detected off of DLNA or Home Server devices, and everything pretty much "just works."If you're really feeling crazy you can tie your media library to your Windows Live ID and access your home media from anywhere over the internet"
"Windows ExplorerIt's hard to quantify most of the changes to the basic file browser activities in this release, other than to say "it just works" quite a bit more frequently than it did in Vista"
"It's smarter about spotting file types, there are solid in-pane previews of music, pictures and video (if you know to turn on the preview pane), and the particular folder we're targeting with a drag and drop is lined up in the simplified left hand sections of "Favorites" and "Libraries" more often than not"
"Unfortunately, it's not all roses: some media files we knew the OS was perfectly capable of playing through its Windows Media Player-powered preview pane had somehow been "claimed" by Zune and disabled for playback from within Windows Explorer"
"Looks like somebody missed a meeting"
"Internet ExplorerWe'll be honest: we avoid IE like the plague, and recommend you do as well"
"Microsoft continues to make improvements to the browser, and the nagging, over-protective "training wheels" approach to security is probably appropriate for those naive enough to use this thing, but the fact is that there are too many faster, better and "free-er" browsers out there to really waste much time in Microsoft's default"
"Anecdotally, the browser hard crashed a couple minutes into us writing this paragraph"
"Notable app omissionsWindows MailIt was never the highlight of the OS, but Microsoft has for some reason decided to ship Windows 7 completely without a mail application, unless you count the browser"
"You're encouraged to download Windows Live Mail with the Windows Live Essentials app pack, but while it does an alright job, it's hardly a first string effort, and we're not sure why Microsoft has decided that emailing people isn't really a core functionality of a modern operating system, much less something that Microsoft should have an industry-leading app for inside the box"
"Windows Movie Maker Another item relegated to the Windows Live app pack, and this time slapped with a "Beta" moniker for extra shame"
"We actually have a bit of a soft spot for Microsoft's no-frills approach to movie editing for the everyman, and if YouTube is any indication, Movie Maker certainly gets the job done for a lot of people"
"Still, this is probably something that should be spruced up and packed in with the OS, and we're even more sure that it should support the now-defacto AVCHD format by now"
"Windows Live Photo Gallery You guessed it, another one kicked to Windows Live Essentials land, where supposedly "essential" apps go to die"
"Unfortunately, this particular app seems an even more logical omission, given its too-strong ties to a Windows Live account (something we've owned for years without managing to upload a single photo to, strangely enough)"
"Other sundry necessitiesWe could probably understand this app scarcity a decade ago -- Microsoft's job is only really half done when you buy the OS, they also need to keep that Office team afloat -- but given its modern day competition (Apple and Google, to be specific), it's hard to understand why Microsoft is shipping this OS without a calendar app, PDF viewer, lightweight office replacements or an IM / video conferencing solution"
"Microsoft blames anti-trust laws, stating that it's hard for it to work in all the "services" it wants into its apps if it bundles with the OS, but we'd say most of its applications could do with a bit more "open" when it comes to services (Flickr, YouTube, anything that isn't Windows Live, etc.) anyways"
"In any case, most computer vendors will be striking a deal with Microsoft or Google or whomever to supply some of these necessities with their shipping computers, but we can't help but think that Microsoft is leaving some vital elements of the operating system incomplete and wide open to inconsistent experiences by neglecting all of these app types in this way"
"Security / networkingMicrosoft had already done a lot of work since the initial release of Vista on not bugging us incessantly with pop-up security nags, but Windows 7 strikes an even better balance"
"What is disconcerting is how often security warnings include an "unknown" as the publisher -- it's not really teaching anybody to be judicious about what pops up in the warning if the warning itself doesn't even know what's going on"
"In the end we'll find out just how secure Windows 7 is once it's in the wild and hackers start hammering on it, but with the abundance and ease of Windows updates these days, most anybody with an ounce of common sense and a speedy internet connection should be able to steer clear of danger"
"Meaning: we're all doomed"
"On the networking front, HomeGroups are a new Windows 7-specific method of simplifying networking between computers on a local network, and we're really in love"
"After decades of being stymied by complicated Windows networking setups, we've finally been able to reliably and rapidly connect multiple computers and share files / media / printers / whatever without resorting to a sneakernet or inviting our smarter friends over with their fancy Computer Science degrees to figure it out for us.CompatibilityCheck out our upgrade guide for more info on our specific compatibility issues, but the long and the short of it is that anything we found to work in Vista seemed to work just fine (in some cases better!) in Windows 7"
"That goes for hardware and software, but of course the real test will be when this OS is unleashed upon the masses -- your mom's brother's 25 year old printer might not make the cut, and we'll be sure to pour out a 40 upon its behalf.In truth, Microsoft does a very good job with keeping a truly insane quantity of hardware and drivers and vendors happy, but we still think they could do better"
"New and improved utilities to detect and install hardware are present in Windows 7, but they still don't feel entirely smart enough -- we had to track down plenty of drivers manually, and even dipped a toe now and then into the (shudder) Device Manager, which has hardly received an improvement since World War II"
"There has to be a better way to make sure people don't have to be smart, patient and lucky to get all their hardware working with their OS"
"Of course, it's not a small problem to surmount"
"The brand new Device Stage seems to best illustrate the scope of this issue"
"Microsoft has presented a sort of candy-coated exterior to the Device Manager in the Devices and Printers view, which displays devices it recognizes as large, lickable icons, and lets you drill into further functions with a right click, or a double click if you're feeling lucky"
"Unfortunately, there's only a very small set of devices the OS seems truly at ease with"
"Sure, it picks up on most anything we plug in over USB, seeking out drivers over the internet and installing them quite painlessly, but actual functionality usually leaves a lot to be desired -- a double click usually gives us only the driest of driver-management options"
"Of our oodles of devices, most are represented by a generic NAS icon, many are represented with bizarre names (or eight names, in the case of our E71) and only two devices we tried offered a true Device Stage view, which was merely populated with battery and storage status.It's simultaneously a testament to the insane diversity of devices Microsoft has to deal with, along with the implicit reliance on vendors to provide drivers in a logical and consistent manner"
"We don't imagine the Device Stage will be populated with truly useful infos on our favorite devices for many months (or years) to come"
"Overall speed / stabilitySpeed is really one of Windows 7's major selling points"
"Particularly for the netbook set, Windows 7 can turn a machine that's nearly unusable under Windows Vista (especially if it's been saddled with the manufacturer's own set of crapware) into a quite potent workhorse"
"That's partly to do with the slimmed down kernel of the OS, which has lower memory requirements than Vista, but it's also due to Microsoft's rework of GUI scheduling, which means less bottlenecks and less unresponsive moments"
"Still, it's not perfect"
"On the well-appointed machine we performed an in-place upgrade from Vista on (trust us, a clean install is worth the hassle, learn from our mistakes) we found Gadgets taking a while to load on boot, occasional system-wide slowdowns when we were doing a tad "too much" with media, and Internet Explorer felt pretty sad compared to the competition.While streaming Windows Media Center to our Xbox 360 we had trouble maintaining an internet connection, or perhaps a network connection -- it was unclear which was dropping"
"After we disconnected and reconnected the network would work again, but would break soon after"
"We eventually gave up and restarted, after which things seemed to work just fine"
"Our worst experiences, however, were with a clean install to a quite modern netbook"
"The OS became increasingly unstable over time -- Windows Explorer itself seemed to be the main culprit -- and the machine eventually failed to boot entirely"
"Luckily, the Startup Repair utility managed to jump to the rescue and found a System Restore point that booted fine, though we lost the few customizations we'd made up to that point and were face with basically a fresh install again"
"It was nice of Windows 7 to recover itself so well, but we would obviously have preferred to not run into that issue in the first place"
"SKUsAs for pricing and SKU confusion"
"Well, you'll have to decide that one for yourself: FROMXP / VISTA	FROM WIN7 STARTERFROM WIN7 HOME PREMIUMFROM WIN7 PROFULL PRICE	HOME PREMIUM	$119.99*$79.99N/AN/A$199.99	PRO	$199.99$114.99$89.99N/A$299.99	ULTIMATE	$219.99$164.99$139.99$129.99$319.99Full feature lists and additional SKUs can be found here"
"Family Pack info is here.Madness"
"Yes"
"But there are still some decent options for most people, and if you've gotten a jump on things you might have already scored yourself that $50 upgrade -- don't you feel smug"
"In the long run, most people will end up getting Windows 7 with a new machine, so perhaps it doesn't matter so much, but we still wouldn't mind if Microsoft did a bit more work trimming down these full version pricetags"
"Doesn't Microsoft want those too-cool-for-school Apple hipsters dabbling in the dark side via Bootcamp?Wrap-upWhere Vista felt like a sprawling mess, Windows 7 has patched up the holes and feels like a tight, unified mechanism"
"It's hardly full of surprises, but that's usually a good thing when it comes to operating systems"
"If you've never been a Windows person, there's hardly anything here that will change your mind about that"
"However, most human beings on this planet have some sort of interaction with Windows on a regular basis, whether by choice or necessity, and Windows 7 is great news for those millions of souls"
"Instead of switching up the formula, Windows 7 is really an extension and a refinement of the true tenets of Windows (that we just made up): broad hardware compatibility, coatings of usability over deep functionality, and a "everything for everybody" approach to feature sets and SKUs"
"With such broad aims, and such a diverse userbase, it's no wonder that there are plenty of spots where the OS still falls short, but taken as a whole it's clear that Microsoft has taken a strong step forward with Windows 7"
"The world will know on October 22.Prologue: A troubled pastA bit less than three years ago, Windows Vista was officially launched after a long delay"
"The operating system brought a raft of long-overdue new features to the Windows platform to make it truly fit for hardware of the 21st century"
"In came a new graphics stack and sound stack, as well as significant security, networking, and storage changes.The changes were all well and goodâ€”the graphics work in particular was essential to allow Windows to offer functionality equivalent to that found in Mac OS X for many yearsâ€”but they came at a high cost"
"To take advantage of all the new features required the use of all-new Windows Vista hardware drivers"
"In the OS's early days, these were often slow, unreliable, or simply non-existent"
"In spite of the extended development process and lengthy open beta, many vendors were apparently caught off-guard by Windows Vista's release and its preference for new drivers, so they chose to ignore the new OS for many months.Software vendors didn't fare much better"
"Vista's new User Account Control (UAC) system meant that most of the time even administrators were stripped of their full privileges, forcing all software to run as a regular user account; full access was only provided after a confirmation prompt"
"Though software should long ago have stopped requiring admin rightsâ€”Windows NT had this kind of security since its inceptionâ€”the reality was that many applications lazily assumed that the person running them would have full administrator privileges all the time"
"Take those privileges away, and the programs start breaking.As for its impact on users, Vista also brought with it higher hardware demands that caused many to recoil in horror"
"This wasn't a new phenomenon, of course; Windows XP and Windows 2000 before it both had the same effect"
"So big, so bloated, so slowâ€”these are traditional criticisms leveled at any new Windows release, and Vista was no exception"
"In truth, Vista's hardware requirements were not egregious; the problem was that in comparison to XP's ancient, five-year-old requirements, Vista's requirements represented a big step up, especially in the area of video hardware.So when Windows Vista became publicly available in early 2007, the reception was rather lukewarm"
"Third-party hardware and software support was spotty, backwards compatibility was reduced, and system demands were markedly higher"
"This led to a computing public that clamored for the continued availability of Windows XP, and many businesses (chipmaker Intel among them) swore off the new version of Windows in favor of its ancient predecessor"
"This was unfortunate"
"Sure, the new operating system had teething trouble, but this was nothing new.XP also got booedLong-time Windows observers will remember that XP's reception was immensely hostile, and for substantially the same reasons; users migrating from Windows 98 found that the new Windows didn't work with their hardware, didn't work with their software, ran slower, and used more memory"
"And who would want that"
"Business users similarly saw little compelling reason to migrate from Windows 2000 (which was then less than two years old), as XP offered them relatively little.The thing that XP had on its side was time"
"XP should have been replaced by Windows Longhorn in 2004 or 2005, but the cancellation of the Longhorn project and subsequent wait for Vista meant that everyoneâ€”users, software developers, hardware vendorsâ€”treated Windows XP as the main (or even only) version of Windows, with the result that everything worked with XP"
"The early woes were forgotten, and XP, old and clunky as it was, became the version of Windows that everyone loved and adored (or at least, tolerated).Just as XP was fundamentally not as bad as its initial reception would lead one to believe, the same was true of Vista"
"Stripped of the Vista name and placed in front of unsuspecting users, "Windows Mojave" was warmly received"
"And even corporate customers have started to migrate to the OS.Vista was progress, and it paved the way for Windows 7Although Windows Vista may have caused vendors and users alike some amount of pain, it was all for a good reason"
"To take advantage of modern video cards, Windows needed a new graphics stack; to withstand the increasing malware onslaught, Windows needed to tighten security and make running as a regular user more comfortable"
"These changes were not made lightly; the break with the past was necessary to put the operating system on the same footing as its competition and to address long-standing, legitimate criticisms of the platform"
"Microsoft was never going to revert to a more XP-like operating system, no matter how desperately some cling to the old OS.Indeed, in this writer's view, Vista was far and away the best version of Windows ever shipped; the searchable Start menu alone ensured it received that accolade"
"I have way too many icons in my Start menu and way too many documents on my PC for hunting through hierarchies to ever be an effective way of finding, well, anything"
"Hitting the Windows key and then just typing what I'm looking for beats browsing hierarchies hands-down"
"And it's like crack; I was hooked from the first time I ever did it, and using Windows XP (with its dumb old-fashioned Start menu) feels like stepping back into the 1980s"
"People put up with that"
"And for so long?"
"Unbelievable"
"But I digress.The Start menu wasn't the only positive change in Vista"
"The new video subsystem, for example, meant that I'm no longer beholden to the likes of NVIDIA or ATI for my computer's stability"
"My video drivers still crash, but hey, it no longer bluescreens my machine"
"Vista moved the bulk of video drivers into user mode, which means that they can crash and be restarted more or less seamlessly"
"In a similar vein, upgrading video drivers without rebooting is now a reality"
"Moving from video to sound, Vista's new sound stack lets me set my audio volume on a per-application basis, which is another feature I can't believe I lived without.In the end, Vista brought a lot of good stuff"
"It was a major overhaul of the platform, and in retrospect, it's not entirely surprising that the transition was somewhat imperfect"
"Third parties could, and should, have done better, but they have at least caught up now.Windows 7 can take advantage of the two and a half years of progress that hardware and software vendors have made in supporting Vista"
"It can exploit the fact that Moore's Law means even cheap netbooks have got the horsepower to run the new OS"
"Vista's life was always going to be hard; any major update to a platform as diverse and widely used as Windows is always going to be met with resistance"
"But Vista has done its job; XP is no longer the target platform for developers, and vendors are producing hardware and software that works with the stricter security and modernized graphics and audio subsystems.Windows 7 has an important job to do"
"First, it must consolidate the architectural changes that made Vista so painful, and to provide small refinements to the platform and smooth off rough edges"
"And second, it has to be a version of Windows that people want to run, and it needs to be this right out the gate"
"Another stumbleâ€”especially one that leaves customers still clinging to the obsolete Windows XPâ€”would be bad news of course for Redmond, and bad news for the computer industry as a whole; a shiny new version of Windows should help sell hardware, and in a troubled economic climate, vendors need every bit of assistance they can get.Version madnessThe first thing Microsoft has done to make Windows 7 more palatable is to rationalize some of the version madness that afflicted Vista"
"From an economic perspective, creating multiple versions for different market segments makes a lot of senseâ€”it lets Redmond charge more to businesses than to home usersâ€”but the situation with Vista was hostile in the extreme.The mainstream versions of Vistaâ€”Home Premium, Business, Enterprise, and Ultimateâ€”contained almost arbitrary sets of features"
"For example, Home Premium included DVD video support without third-party software"
"Business and Enterprise, however, did not, so any corporate users hoping to watch a DVD on a flight had to look to third-party software"
"Conversely, the (fantastically awesome and indispensable) Shadow Copy feature was present in Business and Enterprise but not Home Premium"
"Likewise, Tablet PC support was found in the two business-oriented versions, but not the home user versions"
"Users who wanted a mix of "business" and non-"business" features had to spring for the (considerably more expensive) Ultimate edition.Windows 7 resolves the major problem with version fragmentation by making more expensive versions proper supersets of the cheaper versions"
"This makes the product line-up much simpler; pay more money and you get more features"
"There's no longer a need to make trade-offs between the different versions, you simply get the cheapest version that has everything you need.Nonetheless, Windows 7 still has a plethora of versions"
"From worst to best, these are: Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate"
"In practice, though, there are only three versions that matter"
"Starter Edition is worthless; it's crippled (it omits most of the user-visible features that make Vista and Windows 7 worthwhile), only available for 32-bit systems, only available as an OEM pre-install, and really should never have seen the light of day"
"Its only purpose is to allow Microsoft to have a dirt-cheap OS to offer to netbook makers as an alternative to Linux, but frankly you'd be better off with a pocket calculator"
"Home Basic is restricted to emerging markets; though less limited than Starter edition, it too lacks most of the features that make Windows 7 attractive to consumers"
"Enterprise and Ultimate can be taken together; they're identical except for their licensing; Enterprise is for volume license customers, Ultimate is available through retail and OEM channels.This means that there will in general be three feature sets for consumers to pick from; Home Premium, Professional, and Ultimate"
"As the name suggests, Home Premium is suitable for most home users; Professional is aimed at small and medium businesses, and Enterprise/Ultimate at large corporates/geeks who just gotta have it all"
"Wikipedia has a more detailed tabulation of which version contains what; there seems little point in reproducing it here.Even with the new feature line-up, not everything makes sense"
"Remote Desktop support is only available in Professional and higher; Home Premium users don't get the ability to remotely view their PC's desktop"
"Unless, that is, they install the (free) Live Mesh beta, which provides remote desktop support for all"
"One might suggest that perhaps the left hand is not so familiar with what the right hand is doing; if remote desktop support is a feature that we can have for a free download, on any supported version of Windows, why not let us use the (technically superior) built-in facility?One thing not found in the new versions is any follow-up to the Ultimate Extras debacle"
"Anyone shelling out for the full Vista Ultimate was promised desirable new features and add-ons over the course of the product's lifetime"
"What they got was a couple of games (a briefly distracting but ultimately uncaptivating Texas Hold 'Em poker game, and a rather more intriguing robotic puzzle game that I'm sorry to see hasn't made it to Windows 7), some improvements to BitLocker and EFS, animated wallpapers, and, er, that's about it"
"The value proposition of the Ultimate Extras was nothing short of piss-poor, and Microsoft's support for them thoroughly lackadaisical"
"The concept was always dubiousâ€”any add-on that was really any good shouldn't be restricted to the niche Ultimate SKU, so what Extras they did produce were always condemned to being mediocre"
"Recognition of this is likely one of the factors that led to Vista Ultimate's price being cut, but that does little to satisfy those who paid the original asking price"
"Frankly, I think the company should apologize for taking people's money but failing to deliver anything even remotely close to what it promised"
"Anyway, that horrible mistake is now behind us; Windows 7 Ultimate has no Extras.Pricing and upgrade optionsOn top of the considerably more sane version lineup, Microsoft has also cut certain retail prices"
"Windows 7 Home Premium is cheaper than its predecessor, and Windows 7 Professional, though priced the same as Windows Vista Business, now gives better value as it incorporates all the features from Home Premium"
"That's not all"
"Redmond has introduced a Windows 7 Family Pack; this is a low-price upgrade pack allowing three separate PCs to be upgraded to Home Premium"
"The Family Packs will not be available universally; currently only North America and parts of Europe are eligible, and are a limited-time release, available only while stocks last.Though the software giant has offered upgrade editions since time immemorial, this is the first time it has priced them so aggressively and so attractively"
"Upgrades have always received discounted pricing, sure, but $50 per system is less than any previous upgrade, by quite a margin"
"Redmond traditionally has depended on hardware sales (with their OEM pre-installs) to move most Windows licenses"
"The speed at which each new version of Windows is taken up is largely governed by the rate at which hardware is replaced, with retail and upgrade sales a relatively small proportion of the overall installed base"
"This trend has been bucked somewhat by Vista; the new operating system didn't cause a surge in sales, and a significant number of users opted to use the downgrade rights to stick with XP"
"The Family Packs should kickstart the migration process and do so independently of hardware sales.The upgrade editions are available to anyone running Windows 2000, XP, or Vista, although only Vista users will receive a true upgrade"
"Though 2000 and XP are eligible for upgrade pricing, the install media will not perform an upgrade; instead, it will perform a clean installation, moving the old operating system and installed programs out of the way"
"While many advocate clean installs even for upgraders, the truth is that it's convenient to be able to perform an in-place upgrade and hence avoid reinstalling all your software; I've been performing (unsupported) upgrades of the Windows 7 betas, and they've all gone very smoothly, albeit rather slowly.The install processIt is something of a tradition in OS reviews to focus excessively on the installation process"
"On the one hand, this is absurd; an OS's installation represents only a tiny fraction of the OS experienceâ€”at worst it takes an hour or two, compared to the many thousands of hours that will be spent actually using the OS"
"One the other hand, for any OS not preinstalled, the installation is a necessary hurdle that must be cleared before it can be used.The installerPerhaps cognizant of the relative unimportance of the installer in an OS that's normally preinstalled anyway, or perhaps out of sheer laziness, the Windows NT installer has traditionally been the worst of any mainstream OS"
"The text-mode blue-screen portion of the installer includes such wonderful features as being incapable of loading third-party disk drivers from any source other than a floppy disk"
"A perfectly sound decision in 1993, of course, but over XP's life it went from being tolerable (if short-sighted) to an infuriating anachronism; to install XP onto a reasonably modern machine using SATA and AHCI (or motherboard RAID) meant either tainting a brand new PC with an appalling bit of legacy hardware (the day of the 3.5" floppy drive has long since passed) or constructing a custom boot CD that includes the drivers already, a process that typically took me about 20 dud burned CDs before I finally managed to concoct one that did the job.Vista finally fixed these long-standing annoyances"
"The new installer is all graphical, with a mouse and everything, so gone is the cutting-edge 1980s technology motif that permeated the old installer"
"Even more welcome than this is that the new installer can load drivers from sources other than floppy disks"
"CDs, USB keys, and hard drives can all be used as a source of drivers"
"With Windows 7, the install medium itself is no longer restricted to optical media; though boxed copies will all be DVD (Vista included a 5-CD option, but that's now gone), Windows 7 can be installed from USB key or hard disk, which makes for much faster installs, not to mention much less frustration when trying to customize the process.One of the objectives of the new Windows 7 installer was to cut down the number of questions asked that make installation less interactive; previous versions of Windows would ask questions about networking minutiae and other trivia part-way through the process, so it required some degree of babysitting"
"The few questions that are asked now occur either at the start of the install or near the very end"
"The questions have been tweaked a little to move them around, but the overall process will be familiar to those who've installed Vista, and a welcome relief to those used to XP.Installation itself is pretty quick; an install into a Virtual PC VM on my rather slow laptop took about half an hour (Vista took a bit longer, about 50 minutes, into a similar VM)"
"The new OS is somewhat smaller on-disk than Vista; the fresh Vista SP2 install is around 7 GB (excluding the pagefile etc.), Windows 7 is around 5"
"The new smaller size is a deliberate ploy to make Windows 7 more attractive to netbooks"
"The biggest single reason for Vista's large size was the substantial number of drivers it included"
"Though these made for a good user experienceâ€”they increased the chance that a device would work automaticallyâ€”they also occupied a lot of space"
"Before the widespread use of netbooks and other machines with small, often solid-state, disks, it was worth using the extra space"
"The huge growth in use of SSDs has, for the time being, reversed that storage trend, so saving space is more valuable than it once was"
"Dedicating a large chunk of space to drivers that probably weren't going to be used anyway was no longer worthwhileâ€”especially as more prevalent network connectivity and a more complete Windows Update mean that up-to-date drivers are just a download away anyway"
"Drivers aren't the only thing that have been stripped out, but they're the biggest.As slow as upgrading can be, it does seem to do a good job of migrating data and programs while still providing a robust install procedure even in the face of screwed up system configurations"
"Before the upgrade process starts, it performs pre-flight checks to warn of incompatible hardware or software, insufficient disk space, etc., so potential issues can be detected and repaired before they become real problems.Windows Vista introduced the Anytime Upgrade, allowing upgrading between versions to be performed without having to reinstall, with pricing equivalent to the price difference between versions"
"This was a new capability; XP offered no upgrade pricing or capability to users wishing to switch from, say, XP Home to XP Professional, instead requiring a full reinstall of a full-price copy"
"Windows 7 streamlines the Anytime Upgrade process so that switching versions takes around 10 minutes and doesn't even require physical media"
"The Windows 7 install process installs everything to disk; the Anytime Upgrade merely unlocks what's already present.In keeping with the minimal interaction goal of the install process, at no point are you asked which features you want to install"
"Instead, the available components are managed (as with Vista) in a separate dialog accessed through Control Panel"
"By default, quite a few things are omitted, though most of these are of fairly narrow interest (for example, Web developers might well want the IIS web server installed)"
"One thing that has people excitedâ€”especially legislatorsâ€”is the ability to remove Internet Explorer 8"
"If IE8 is unticked, then Windows removes all user-visible ways of invoking the Web browser"
"The "working" parts of the browser are unaffected because so many applications (including the OS itself) embed them for various reasons, so the rendering engine is still present and still important, but as an actual Web browser, IE8 can now be fully removed.Shell and user interfaceDesktopOnce up and running, after briefly admiring the new startup logo, you're presented with probably the ugliest default wallpaper of any current OS; even the fecal brown of Ubuntu is more aesthetically pleasing"
"The Windows 7 betas had an amusing fish as their wallpaper (a betta fish; betta, beta, geddit?)"
"The fish has unfortunately had his chips and is gone, replaced by a frankly gross Windows logo overlaid with silhouettes of trees, butterflies, and random dots"
"The styling is inconsistent with the visual cues in the rest of the operating system (it doesn't follow from the theming of either the new startup screen or the logo on the Start orb, or anywhere else that the logo is used), it's inconsistent with the Aero Glass appearance that 7 inherits from Vista"
"And, most importantly, it's just irredeemably ugly and horrid.This is horrible"
"Horrible.This is a pity, because some of the other wallpapers provided with Windows 7 are very nice indeed"
"7 has a handful of new themes that include some nice photographs and fun artwork"
"As with Vista, users in some countries will also have a custom country-specific theme showing landmarks and vistas belonging to their nation"
"I'm sure some focus group or designer somewhere will justify the default wallpaper and explain how wonderful it is, but I couldn't stand to look at it and I think it falls a long way short of the standard set by the other themes"
"Architecture is my favorite.Once the hideousness of the wallpaper has been overcome, careful observers might notice that Vista's Sidebar has disappeared, but its Gadgets remain"
"Gadgets now float above any desktop icons, below all windows"
"I think this is a better place for them (they no longer impinge on the usable area of the screen, which I appreciate on my laptop), but I still don't find myself using them to any great extent"
"I have a weather widget that's handy, but none of the other bundled ones inspire me, and though there are now a few hundred to download, there are few that strike me as particularly compelling"
"There are things I would like to have as Gadgets (a nice Twitter reader, for example), but the overall selection is poor"
"This isn't helped by poor support from Microsoft; there are a couple of Outlook gadgets out there to do things like show upcoming appointments, but honestly, these things should ship with Office, not as separate downloads"
"Promote the technology, don't just let it languish, unloved.I can at least now add Gadgets without worrying about running out of memory"
"The memory footprint of Gadgets in Vista was awful; different Gadgets ran in different processes, and as best I could tell they leaked memory like a sieve"
"That no longer appears to be the case.AppearanceWindows 7 will look familiar to Vista users; it retains the Aero Glass theme with its translucent, textured window borders"
"There are some minor modifications, as the window borders and taskbar no longer go opaque when you maximize a window, but overall the new OS looks very much like the old one, and things that are bad in Vista (the minimal differentiation between active and inactive windows, ugly menu bars) are bad in Windows 7"
"I am disappointed with just how familiar the appearance is, in fact"
"Vista has a lot of visual inconsistencies, both due to a failure to follow new UI guidelines and a failure to pay attention, and many of these are retained in Windows 7"
"It makes the OS look very sloppy; there is a great lack of attention to detail, suggesting that Redmond doesn't really care about how it looks.Some of these inconsistencies are broad in scope"
"Control Panel has a new style of applet that loads up within the Control Panel window rather than in a pop-up dialog box"
"The new style looks better and is more flexible (it can be resized, for example), but many applets use the old style, meaning that you're never quite sure what will happen when you pick an applet"
"Sometimes a new window will pop open, sometimes it won't"
"This was perhaps excusable in Vista, as a transitional OS bridging the old with the new, but the same situation exists in 7"
"Many built-in applets (for example, the mouse control panel) are still stuck in the old style.The mouse control panel is doubly bad, because not only is it still an ugly dialog box, it also reverts to battleship grey"
"Battleship grey should be dead and buried, but a quick peek at the Hardware tab reveals it in all its glory"
"And doesn't it look splendid"
"The new, themed white tab with ugly battleship grey contents"
"It's even more jarring because the border around the content area is still themed and white, leaving a strange white line down the left-hand side of the window.This is the right styling.This ain't.And OK, it's being picky, but why oh why do Explorer and Internet Explorer look different"
"They are meant to look the same"
"An attempt has clearly been made to give them the same styling and appearance"
"Yet they're gratuitously different"
"Not terribly different, but different all the same"
"The spacings are different, and the address bars are different heights"
"It's just haphazard and random"
"The widgets have been plopped down onto a window and someone's just said "yeah, that looks close enough", even though it's wrong"
"Fit and finish matters"
"As the new UI guidelines say: Pay attention to detail, and make sure everything is polished"
"Don't assume that users won't notice small things"
"They will.TaskbarThe most remarkable new feature of Windows 7, and the one that people will interact with most often, is the new taskbar"
"I've covered this in detail before, but for those new to the new appearance, I'll give a brief overview.The new taskbar melds the old Quick Launch toolbar with the traditional taskbar, providing a single place to both launch applications and switch between them"
"Replacing the mix of small Quick Launch icons and large textual buttons, we have simply a row of large icons"
"Left clicking an icon either starts or switches to the app"
"If the application has a single window, clicking the icon switches directly; if it has multiple windows, clicking the icon presents a thumbnail view of each window, requiring a second click to switch to a specific window.The concept is a refinement of the collapsing system introduced in XP (wherein multiple windows would be stacked onto a single button if the taskbar became sufficiently busy), combined with the on-hover thumbnails in Vista"
"Instead of a dedicated Quick Launch area, any application can have its icon pinned to the taskbar, making it a permanent fixture"
"Just as with the Quick Launch area, icons can be dragged and dropped to change their ordering; this applies also to the icons for running applications, providing the taskbar icon re-ordering that many Windows users have wanted since the taskbar was introduced.Right-clicking the buttons shows the Jump List, a special context menu that can be customized by applications to provide quick access to application features.Having used the new taskbar for approaching a year now, I think that overall, it's an improvement on its predecessor"
"The ability to pin and rearrange icons means that my core applications are always in the same place, which is certainly welcome"
"It also scales better for situations when I have many applications and windows open; by using large icons instead of textual buttons, I can have more applications running before things become unintelligible or (worse) I have to scroll"
"That said, the Mac OS X Dock still scales better"
"If the taskbar does fill up then, just as in the olden days, I'm still left with dumb scrollbars to page through the buttons"
"I can't pin as many buttons as I would like to the taskbar, because it'll mean that much of the time I'll have to scroll, which is, I think, unacceptable"
"Sure, I can make the taskbar taller, but it's already taller than the old one, and there's a limit to how much space I want the taskbar to gobble on my piddly laptop screen.The new taskbar and its Jump Lists offer software developers a lot more customizability than previous versions of Windows"
"A few built-in applications make good use of this"
"Internet Explorer 8 has the most complete integration, and serves as a good example of what's possible"
"Its Jump List is customized so that it includes both custom tasks (starting an InPrivate session, opening a new tab) and direct access to recently visited sites"
"The thumbnails are customized, so that instead of the default, built-in, one-thumbnail-per-window, it shows one thumbnail per tab (allowing direct access to any tab)"
"And finally, IE uses overlays to indicate download progress"
"Windows Media Player 12 also offers rich customization of its thumbnails by placing a miniature set of buttons on the thumbnail to provide direct control of playback.The big problem is that the number of applications offering this level of integration is currently low"
"Even within Windows itself, most of the built-in applications offer either no customization at all, or they drop back to the default automatic Jump List that is available to any application that uses the built-in Most Recently Used feature"
"This makes the experience quite hit-and-miss, which rather detracts from it"
"Granted, Windows 7 is brand new, and so it will be quite some time before software is updated to take advantage of these new capabilities; and we're already beginning to see third party software add Jump List items (for example, Chrome adds entries for recently closed tabs and opening incognito windows, and iTunes has playback controls in its thumbnail and adds tasks for visiting and searching the iTunes Store).Chrome has a Jump ListBut so far, it's far from universal"
"Windows Live Wave 3 included extensive integration for Messenger, with both customized icons (to show your status) and an extensive Jump List, but this doesn't extend to other pieces of software in the suite"
"I would like Windows Live Mail, for example, to include a count of new mails in its icon and offer Jump List tasks for new mail, send-and-receive, and so on, but it doesn't"
"With luck, Wave 4 will start filling out these gaps"
"Likewise, Office 2010 should provide a similar level of integration for Outlook and friends.I just hope Microsoft follows through on this integration"
"One of the notable features of Windows Vista is that its good new UI elements weren't integrated into first-party software"
"For example, Windows Vista provided a (much-welcome) replacement for Windows' traditional "Yes/No/Cancel" dialog boxes"
"These have been around since the days of Windows 3, if not before, and they're really pretty awful"
"They force dialog boxes to phrase questions just so to fit the available options, and the generic buttons have only a weak link to the action that will be performed"
"Vista made possible dialog boxes whose buttons contain actual actions, rather than these generic options, which was a big improvement.."
"except virtually no developer bothered to actually use them"
"Flagship products like Office 2007 stuck with the same old crappy "Yes/No/Cancel" questions, completely ignoring the new capabilities afforded by the new OS"
"Even within Vista itself, old-style, unhelpful dialog boxes are there to be found, a trend that has unfortunately continued with Windows 7.This all results in a poor, inconsistent experience"
"Sure, a platform with the long history of Windows is always going to have applications that stick with legacy practices and fail to conform to new guidelines"
"That's one of the costs of progress; old software looks old, and doesn't keep up with the new look and feel"
"But it shouldn't be an issue within the OS itself"
"The OS itself should do the Right Thing"
"So should new versions of first-party applications; they should show off the new features and show third party developers what they should be doing"
"But with Vista, they never did, and Windows 7 is off to a shaky start here, as well.Note: Back at PDC last year, we talked to Steve Sinofsky about this; Windows adds UI capabilities and then Microsoft software fails to use it properly, resulting in an inconsistent experience and leading one to question why Microsoft even bothers adding new features and guidelines if they're not going to be used"
"He told us at the time that the reason for this is that within Microsoft, the software that sets the UI standard isn't Windows, but rather Office; if the Office team's UI rules don't match up with Windows' UI rules, then the Office team prevails"
"He did tell us that the Office team was involved in the new UI features of Windows 7, and so I hope that in the future there will be closer alignment between what Microsoft says you should do, and what it actually does"
"I'm not going to hold my breath, though, because interface consistency is not something the company has ever been good at.The taskbar's other main feature, the Start menu, is largely unaltered from Vista"
"Just as in that OS, typing with the Start menu open performs a search, to provide quick and easy access to programs and documents"
"For me, this searchable Start menu was sufficient justification to switch to Vista; once you get in the habit of reflexively searching the Start menu, it's painful to go back to the XP Start menu"
"The only notable change is that Jump Lists are integrated into the Start menu, too"
"Well; the only notable change if you're coming from the Vista Start menu"
"If you're coming from XP, or if you disabled the new Start menu in Vista, then you might be in for a shock, as the new Start menu is now mandatory"
"Vista provided the option to switch to the old style, but that option is now absent"
"Microsoft wants you to use the new Start menu, so by golly you're gonna use it.Explorer and Control PanelExplorer received quite a facelift in Vista, and Windows 7 Explorer refines the appearance a great deal (no more ugly blue-green toolbar), retaining good things like the clickable breadcrumb bar and ubiquitous search box.Unfortunately, Windows 7's Explorer also retains bad things, like the monumentally stupid Search window"
"Searching in Windows 7, as with Vista, is fast and easy"
"It's just that anything other than keyword search is a nightmare, because there's no kind of search builder"
"The search interface is just a text box to type in"
"For keyword search, that's fineâ€”just type in the keywords"
"But if you want to do something more structured, then you need to use magic or guesswork or something"
"There are ways of searching metadata, but you have to know the trick.The opposite of advanced search.For example, if you want to search by last-modified date, you have to know that the search tag is "datemodified:""
"Type that in, and you get a nice little calendar to pick a date, as well as special terms like "a long time ago""
"Similarly, if you know that the magic tag is "size:" you can pick a range of sizes from "empty" to "gigantic""
"That's great if you know the magic tags, but there's a hell of a lot of magic tags that I don't know"
"What I want is something discoverable and explorable, so I can find the different criteria, rather than just leaving me on my own to guess at them"
"A few example tags are provided (and these are context-sensitive, so if I search my music folders, it suggests tags like artist and album), but there's no intuitive way of figuring out what tags there are.The tags are neat when they work, but what are they all?Similarly, Control Panel is still the subject of pseudo-random organization, and is still an utterly inconsistent mishmash of new-style panels (which I like) and old-style dialog boxes (which I don't)"
"I'm no longer sure why they even bother with the (default) category view; the only way to get any value from Control Panel is to search it, which fortunately works very well.Libraries and Device StageStill, it's not all bad"
"Explorer has some nice new bits and pieces in the form of Libraries and Device Stage"
"I first covered Libraries back at PDC; to recap, they're kind of "virtual folders" that aggregate files in different locations according to the type of those files"
"Since PDC, the concept has been refined a little; there are now just four special kinds of Library: Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos, and a fifth generic option"
"The four special options all change the default appearance of the Library (and the tags that get suggested for file searches)"
"Both local (including removable) disks and network shares can be added, provided that they're indexed by Windows Search 4.0.I find the Libraries work well enough, but in practice, they aren't groundbreaking, and don't make a huge difference to the way I use my computer"
"They're more convenient than mere shortcuts to different locations (I keep most of my music and photos on a file server, so having the content of the fileserver displayed in the same place as local content is certainly a good thing), but at the end of the day they don't actually do that much"
"The best use of Libraries is probably Windows Media Player 12; whereas past versions of WMP have had their own "library" concept, in Windows 7 WMP simply uses the standard Music library to source its tunes"
"WMP and Media Center are unfortunately the only programs (thus far) I've found to work this way; I would hope that future versions of Windows Live Photo Gallery make similar changes.With the addition of Libraries, Windows users now have a large proportion of the functionality that was promised with the (long-cancelled) WinFS"
"Once upon a time, WinFS would have been a database-based filesystem, which would provide, amongst other things, fast searching, virtualized folders that grouped content according to its type, and an extension of these features to non-local storage"
"Through Windows Search and Libraries we now have these same abilitiesâ€”only without the immense technical complexity that undermined WinFS"
"With the addition of file synchronizationâ€”a feature provided by Live Meshâ€”almost every capability of WinFS is now available.Device Stage was also shown off at PDC, and is part of a broader overhaul of how devices attached to the system are exposed to the user"
"A lot of people today use multifunction devicesâ€”printers that are also scanners and fax machines, 3G data cards that are also SD card readers, webcams that are also microphonesâ€”and these devices have been represented poorly in Windows"
"Different functions of different devices appear in different places (Scanners are distinct from Printers, for example, even though they're often the same hardware), and sometimes don't appear at all, leaving no single location to go to to configure, monitor, and troubleshoot them, and with no visible relationship of which functions are constituent parts of the same multifunction device.Device and Printers in all its glory"
"Note how the 3G broadband card yields a multitude of dumb icons.With Windows 7, most (if not all) connected devices, both USB and Bluetooth, now appear in the single Devices and Printers control panel"
"If the device is supported by Device Stage, it has a pretty little icon that looks like what it is; everything else gets generic icons that range from tolerable (printers, Bluetooth dongles) to downright confusing (network adapters)"
"Most of the devices I have (and I would expect most of the devices that most people have, at least for the time being) don't have any special support"
"Their context menus have some appropriate options (viewing the print queue, adjusting properties of network adapters, etc.), providing quick access to a range of settings, but nothing that wasn't possible before.Some devices, however, have Device Stage support from their vendors"
"These devices can be drilled into to show the pretty new Device Stage screens"
"Of all the devices I have at the moment, only my printer and my actual laptop have support for this, which is a little boring as neither of them really do very much with it"
"My most multifunction device (my cell phone) doesn't have any special support, so although it's a modem, a card reader, has syncing for contacts and e-mails, a camera, a GPS device, etc., I don't get to see any of that from Device Stage, not even as some kind of generic multifunction device or Windows Mobile phone.My printer's Device Stage is pretty simplistic, but it has a pretty pictureDevice Stage for entire computers is also possibleThe execution is a little flawed in other ways"
"Devices with multiple functions aren't always properly consolidated"
"In the screenshot, the five "unspecified" devices at the bottom are all part of the same physical hardware; they're a Sprint EVDO USB stick"
"Why it shows all these various functions I don't know; most of them don't really do much of anything anyway, so I guess it's just some side-effect of the way the drivers were written"
"Either way, these things shouldn't show up separately, because they're not separate devices"
"Similarly, the integrated webcam is labeled "USB Composite Device", even though it's just a webcam"
"Sure, technically it's part of a composite device, but it's a composite of one"
"It would be much better if it were called "Integrated Camera", as it is in Device Manager.The idea behind Devices and Printers and Device Stage seems to be good enough"
"A user-friendly, one-stop shop for showing and configuring hardware makes sense, and showing multifunction devices as single objects with multiple functions is a lot clearer than the alternative"
"But again, as is so often the case with Windows, there's a big dependence on third-parties to actually support this stuff, and until they do, the experience is inconsistent and lackluster"
"If vendors can sort out this mess and do their part, it'll be a worthy addition to the platform; but if nine times out of ten my devices won't have a Device Stage, I'm probably not going to bother the one time in ten that they do.Keyboardability and window managementOne of the things that has long annoyed me about Windows is that basic window management operations aren't keyboardable"
"No, pressing alt-space, x to maximize a window doesn't count; I want simple keystrokes to do these simple, standard operations"
"It seems that Redmond has finally noticed this glaring omission, and Windows 7 sports a new range of keyboard shortcuts, along with some handy new window management features"
"Aero Snap resizes windows by dragging them to the screen edge; dragging to the top edge maximizes the window, dragging maximized windows away from the top of the screen restores them, and dragging windows to the left and right edges makes the window occupy the left or right half of the screen"
"If a window has its resize border dragged to the top of the screen, it is automatically resized to fill the screen height"
"These operations all have keyboard counterparts; Win+Up to maximize, Win+Down to restore, Win+Left or Right to fill one half, and Win+shift+Up to fill the screen height.Less obviously useful is Aero Shake; waggle a window by its title bar, and every other window will minimize"
"Waggle it again, and the other windows all reappear"
"This apparently makes sense in touch scenarios; with the mouse it's downright absurd"
"The keyboard shortcut for this one is Win+Home"
"Windows can be moved between monitors with Win+shift+Left or Right"
"There's also a handy accessibility feature; holding down the Windows key and + zooms in the entire desktop; Windows key and - zooms back out"
"Though this isn't anywhere near as fluid as the same capability on MacOS X, it's certainly better than nothing"
"It also doesn't seem entirely reliable"
"I don't know why, I assume it's the Intel graphics driver on my laptop, but every time I try it in docked mode (which puts a strip along the edge of the screen that shows a zoomed in view of the area surrounding the cursor) the magnifier crashes DWM, and DWM doesn't then restart properly (restarting the Desktop Window Manager Session Manager, UxSMS, restores DWM, but it should surely restart on its own)"
"This is particularly annoying, as switching out of docked mode requires DWM to be enabled, meaning that the only option is to fiddle with the registry.Though I don't find any of these quite as handy as the clickable alt-tab screen that Vista introduced, they're all very hard to live without"
"It's amazing it took so long for these operations to become keyboardable, but now that they have, it makes reverting to Vista a less than welcome experience.UACProbably the biggest source of whining about Vistaâ€”bigger even than compatibility issues or performance concernsâ€”was User Account Control, the new feature that meant any attempt to use superuser privileges gets blocked unless you specifically permit it when prompted, with deliberately annoying prompts"
"Though this could on occasion result in seeing a plethora of UAC prompts (especially when installing and configuring the system in the first place, which just happens to be the scenario that most reviewers experience), the reality was that normal usage scenarios resulted in few prompts, certainly not enough to be a daily annoyance"
"Nonetheless, keen to distance Windows 7 from the poor public perception of Vista, Microsoft has changed the default configuration to cause UAC to produce far fewer prompts.Out of the box, UAC prompts will in general only be displayed by third-party installers; any built-in components (such as Control Panel applets) will not display a prompt"
"Instead, they will silently elevate their privileges"
"A few built-in programs are exempted from this; attempts to start an elevated command prompt, for example, will result in a UAC confirmation just as they do on Vista"
"The upshot of this is that malicious software can elevate itself, unprompted, on-demand, which makes one wonder what the point of it all is"
"It's true that even in Vista, UAC could be circumvented, but not so consistently and reliably, nor so trivially"
"Reverting to the Vista behavior is possible, and as with that OS the only truly effective way of being secure is to run as a non-Administrator and enter a username and password whenever elevation is requested.If you do thisâ€”which you probably shouldâ€”then you'll find that Windows 7 has virtually the same number of prompts as Vista does"
"By making it "less annoying" for Administrator users, Microsoft has just made it more likely that home and SOHO users will just run as Administrator all the time, which is precisely what the company was trying to prevent with UAC in the first place.InternalsWhile there's quite a lot new in the look and feel of Windows 7, the internal changes are more modest"
"Vista had radical overhauls of both sound and graphics, and this had significant repercussions in terms of driver support and hardware compatibility"
"For Windows 7, the goal was to build on Vista's new platform without causing more headaches for vendors and consumers alike by breaking stuff.GraphicsVista's most substantial change, both in terms of platform significance and compatibility-breaking headaches, was its new graphics layer, which used Direct3D 9c and a new driver model called WDDM 1.0"
"This transition was painful, no doubt"
"Prior to Vista, 2D applications using the GDI/GDI+ API were hardware-accelerated; indeed, they have been hardware-accelerated since the early 1990s"
"No more in Vista; GDI applications used unaccelerated software rendering"
"Prior to Vista, heterogeneous graphics cards were supported"
"No more in Vista; multiple graphics cards could be used, but only if they shared the same driver (meaning they had to be from the same vendor)"
"Vendors were also slow to produce drivers that were as fast and reliable as their XP ones"
"They do now have performance parity, and are for the most part stable, but at launch Vista definitely represented a backwards step in terms of both graphical speed and reliability.Vista also had some undesirable memory-usage characteristics; every open window used a big chunk of RAM, because the OS created a full-size buffer of each window in main memory"
"This behavior was necessary because GDI in Vista is all software-based, so each window has to be in memory that the CPU can use"
"A second copy of the buffer was then created in video memory, which was used for composing the desktop"
"This meant that at 1280x1024x32-bit color, each window would take a little over 5 MB of system memory and another 5 MB of video memory"
"Even worse, in extreme situations (typically with hundreds of open windows), the system would simply run out of memory completely and disable buffering altogether.Windows 7 is backwards compatible with WDDM 1.0, but introduces a new WDDM 1.1 driver model"
"Almost all the downsides of WDDM 1.0 in Vista are resolved by WDDM 1.1 in 7"
"Key GDI operations are now hardware-accelerated"
"In turn, this means that the main memory buffer is no longer required; each window is buffered in video memory alone"
"In limited scenarios, this can result in a performance reduction (namely, applications that need to examine or manipulate the entire window image now have to read it from video memory, which tends to be slower than reading from main memory), but in general it means that Windows 7 has considerably lower memory usage than Vista; Vista's memory usage scaled according to the number of open windows, 7's system memory usage is constant.WDDM 1.1 also improves multi-GPU support"
"Windows 7 reintroduces heterogeneous multi-GPU systems, allowing mixed-vendor configurations; it also supports combining identical video cards into a single linked display adapter to boost performance"
"It's not immediately clear how this corresponds with the existing technology to do thisâ€”ATI's Crossfire and NVIDIA's SLIâ€”especially as the Windows 7 requirements are far more restrictive; it can only link cards with identical GPUs and memory configurations"
"The lack of heterogeneous multi-GPU support was quite a significant regression in Vista, and its reintroduction in 7 is welcome; it does come at some cost, however, as multi-GPU systems are required to buffer windows in main memory, thereby reverting to Vista-level memory usage.Direct3D 11On top of fixing the problems with Vista's display layer, Windows 7 introduces a bunch of new APIs and features"
"First among these is Direct3D 11, which is a superset of the Direct3D 10.1 in Vista Service Pack 1"
"Its headline feature is support for "compute shaders" to make it easier to use the GPU for general-purpose computation"
"GPUs provide a phenomenal amount of floating point computation power, but harnessing that power for non-graphics applications can be difficult"
"That number-crunching ability comes at the cost of flexibility; things that a regular CPU takes in its stride (branching, for example) are typically much slower on GPUs"
"GPUs tend also to require a different approach to writing programs; they contain tens of cores (many more than desktop CPUs) and so strongly favor software that is data-parallel (performing the same set of operations on a large set of data) rather than task-parallel (performing different operations on a smaller set of data).Prior to D3D11, it was possible to use D3D shaders for general-purpose computing, but developers had to jump through hoops"
"This is because Direct3Dâ€”and, indeed, the shader hardware itselfâ€”was designed for 3D graphics; to send data to the GPU, it had to be packed into textures or triangles, so even algorithms that were not related to 3D graphics had to be written as if they were"
"Though this certainly didn't make general-purpose GPU computing impossible, it did make it clumsier and harder than necessary"
"This in turn put Direct3D at a disadvantage relative to existing technology such as NVIDIA's CUDA, and new initiatives like OpenCL.Compute shaders, however, don't require any of the trappings of 3D graphics"
"With D3D11, developers can write GPU programs without having to shoehorn their data into triangles or textures"
"The compute shader programming model is designed to be more familiar to traditional parallel developers"
"Compute shader programs use a threading model, allowing data to be shared between threads if necessary and enabling random access to data (neither of which were an option with old shaders)"
"As with OpenCL, and unlike CUDA, Direct3D 11 is hardware-independent; compute shader programs will run on any D3D11 hardware (though at the time of writing, that means only ATI).Though compute shaders can be used independently of the graphics pipeline (for software that has no use for it), they are also fully integrated with it, allowing game developers to mix and match compute shading with traditional D3D graphics, to allow, for example, the use of compute shading to perform image post-processing or special effects not otherwise possible.Direct3D 11 also includes better optimization for multiple CPUs, and support for tessellation"
"Tessellation allows the GPU to automatically subdivide surfaces into smaller triangles to provide smoother, better-looking curves, without requiring significantly greater complexity in the polygon models"
"What this means is that in D3D11 games, round things will actually look round.Direct2D, DirectWriteWhile WDDM 1.1 reintroduces acceleration of GDI applications, 2D graphics still don't make full use of the advances in processing power that GPUs have made"
"GDI is still a bitmapped API, and as such still lacks the high level of acceleration and flexibility that vector graphics APIs like Direct3D and WPF provide"
"Microsoft's solution is a new API, imaginatively named Direct2D"
"Direct2D provides the same kind of capabilities as GDIâ€”lines, curves, gradients, rectangles, ellipses, and so onâ€”but uses Direct3D vector graphics behind the scenes, so is fully accelerated and scalable"
"To this, Direct2D adds full support for anti-aliasing, transparency, as well as improved multithreading performance.Direct2D is a little surprising in some ways; Windows Presentation Foundation provided a new 2D graphics API (among other things) using Direct3D 9 for rendering, so why is Microsoft creating another new 2D, D3D-accelerated, API"
"Compatibility is the big reason; WPF is a managed API available only to managed applications; in contrast, Direct2D is a native API, designed for C and C++"
"Further, Direct2D uses Direct3D 10.1 instead of D3D9"
"Though the two are not directly comparable (WPF is a higher-level API that covers more than just 2D graphics) there is nonetheless considerable overlap in scope, and indeed, Direct2D is derived from the internal WPF library that implemented its 2D graphics"
"At the moment, however, the two things remain distinct, with the result that there is a peculiar kind of split in Windows' graphics APIs.Setting aside the legacy GDI API, we now have two similar-but-different 2D APIs; Direct2D for native code, WPF for managed code"
"To confuse things further, there is an official managed wrapper for Direct2D, meaning that managed code applications have two new, modern, up-to-date 2D APIs to choose from"
"Though related, they are nonetheless incompatible with one another"
"It is not impossible that some future version of WPF will use D2D for its 2D drawing, unifying the two and ensuring that they look identical.One feature found in GDI but missing from Direct2D is text"
"This is because text drawing has been spun off into its own API, DirectWrite"
"DirectWrite provides high-quality anti-aliased (including sub-pixel anti-aliasing) text rendering to any API that wants it; GDI, Direct2D, Direct3D, and WPF; the text layout and rendering is decoupled from the graphics technology.CompatibilityWindows Vista represented something of a watershed for compatibility"
"Direct3D 10 was not backported to Windows XP, the driver model was brand new and again, not backported to Windows XP, and these decisions caused a lot of pain"
"The advances and new APIs that Windows 7 makes should not cause any of these problems"
"Windows 7 can use both WDDM 1.0 and 1.1 drivers; using 1.0 drivers forfeits 1.1-specific features (the reduced memory usage, GDI acceleration), but it will still work"
"To ease vendors' lives, the reverse is also true; Windows Vista can use 1.1 drivers natively"
"They just work and operate as if they were 1.0 drivers.The situation is improved for software authors, too"
"Direct3D 10.1 is now available for everyone, even on Direct3D 9 hardware"
"This is because Windows 7 includes a new feature called "Direct3D 10 Level 9", which provides accelerated Direct3D10 capabilities on D3D9-level hardware"
"Microsoft depends on this capability already for Direct2D and Windows 7's DWM; both of these are D3D10.1 applications, and yet both can run on D3D9 hardware"
"There is also a new, high-performance, pure software renderer named WARP, allowing D3D10 processing even when a GPU is unavailable (for example, for providing image processing in a Windows service).Further improving the developer story, many of these features are being backported to Vista"
"The forthcoming Platform Update for Windows Vista will provide Direct2D, DirectWrite, and Direct3D 11 to Windows Vista Service Pack 2"
"Vista won't get all the advantages that Windows 7 hasâ€”it won't be updated to support GDI acceleration or heterogeneous multi-GPU configurations, nor will Vista be rearchitected to get the reduced memory consumption enabled by WDDM 1.1â€”but as a software platform for developers to target, both Vista and Windows 7 should be identical.Other internal odds and sodsThe core Windows kernel is little changed from Vista"
"It is not unchanged, however, and it has a number of improvements"
"Some are primarily motivated by the needs of its internally identical server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 R2"
"Though license limits will cut it short, the kernel now supports up to 256 logical cores; with forthcoming processors like Beckton/Nehalem-EX sporting 8 physical cores (16 logical cores), systems are going to be reaching the previous 64 logical core limit sooner rather than later"
"Larger systems also do more to expose scaling limitations in the kernel; Windows 7 has improvements to the kernel to improve concurrency and scalability"
"The impact of this work on today's hardware is limited; the real dividends will come several years down the line, when tens of logical cores are found even in standard desktops.Other improvements have more impact on end users"
"One of the things that drains battery life in portable computers is that the processor wakes up periodically even when the system is idle"
"Part of this is the way the OS is designed (it has a built-in periodic timer that goes tick-tock constantly), but much of this is because software and drivers schedule various periodic operations"
"An obvious example is a video player; it has to periodically update the screen, and so it might set a timer to do this"
"In power constrained environments, the longer the processor can remain sleeping, the better"
"To that end, Windows 7 does a couple of things; the built-in periodic timer now only wakes up the main processor core, leaving other cores idle, and there is now a facility for applications and drivers to indicate that their times can be delayed by a certain amount"
"Many timers are not particularly time-sensitiveâ€”they require the operation to be done regularly, but aren't too picky about when exactly they triggerâ€”and so allowing them to be delayed means that the OS can coalesce several timers into one"
"This reduces the number of times it must wake the processor, and hence improves battery life.One of the more interesting features, albeit one I've been unable to test, is the new Virtual WiFi feature"
"Given suitable drivers (that I unfortunately lack), a WiFi connection in Windows 7 can operate as an access point"
"There are two main usage scenarios envisaged; creation of small personal networks (with devices connecting in infrastructure mode rather than ad hoc mode), and ICS connection sharing"
"The Virtual WiFi architecture even permits a WiFi connection to be shared by WiFi, with the same adapter both connected to an access point, and acting as an AP"
"The feature currently lacks any kind of user interface; configuration is all performed through the netsh command.Bundled applicationsWindows Vista came with lots of bundled applications; Windows Media Player, Windows Photo Gallery, Windows Mail, Windows Media Center, and Windows Movie Maker"
"Windows 7 has scrapped Mail, Photo Gallery, and Movie Maker moving these applications into an add-on pack called the Windows Live Essentials"
"Microsoft has decoupled them from Windows so that they have their own release cycle and sidestep bundling and anti-trust concerns"
"The company hopes that OEMs will preinstall the Essentials, but apart from a download link, the company does not otherwise promote them within the OS.Windows Media Player 12The two major applications that remain bundled are Windows Media Player, now at version 12, and Windows Media Center"
"I covered WMP12's major new features at PDC, and what we have today is much the same as what we had then (the Now Playing window is slightly redesigned, but that's about the extent of it).The big changes are WMP's new codecs, and the ability to stream media to other devices"
"Windows now ships with built-in support for, among others, MPEG2, MPEG4 (which covers DivX and similar widely-used implementations), and H.264 video, along with AAC audio"
"The support seems to work well enough; the codecs aren't the fastest ones around, which can be a problem especially with H.264, but a large proportion of downloaded video will now play in WMP without requiring the use of third-party codecs.The streaming support allows media playback on other PCs and DLNA devices on the local network"
"What makes this quite clever is that if a device does not support the format being streamed, WMP12 will automatically transcode the data on-the-fly, and offers a range of supported target formats; more details on this can be found in my PDC coverage"
"This streaming support has been extended since PDC to include the ability for a home PC to stream remotely over the Internet, to for example allow playback of your music when posing at Starbucks.Overall the new features of WMP12 work as they should, and they're good features"
"But the thing is, WMP12 is horrible.First, the program's tagging and metadata support remains pathetic"
"For example, WMP still doesn't understand ID3 tags that are written using version 2.4 of the specification; it still doesn't understand that some albums have multiple discs (it's so frustrating to have properly tagged CDs play in track order 1-1-1-1-2-2-2-2-3-3-3-3-etc., but WMP offers no alternative)"
"Explorer shares these same deficits"
"These are long-standing gripes that make managing music in WMP12 a less-than-satisfactory experience.WMP12 makes things worse than its predecessors by, as far as I can tell, removing the "Advanced" Tag Editor altogether"
"OK, the Advanced Tag Editor was never all that powerful or advanced, but it was better than nothing, which is what we have in WMP12"
"Oh, sure, we can type things into the WMP window to make changes to those columns that we have visible, but for even simple batch changes this is unacceptable"
"Features such as adding lyrics or removing incorrect album art are now completely missing; the Advanced Tag Editor was the only option, and now it is gone.And the album art is weak, supporting a maximum image size of only 240x240"
"So while iTunes has reasonable 800x600 album art, WMP relies on tiny little pictures"
"Indeed, the whole album art situation is miserable in WMP, and WMP12 takes another step backwards"
"WMP11 would use embedded album art in preference to the hidden JPEG images stored in each album's directory (the hidden folder.jpg and randomly-named friends that are readily visible on any WMP-managed directories)"
"The hidden files would still only be the small images that WMP downloads, but within the program itself it would display the large embedded image"
"With WMP12 that's no longer the case"
"The hidden JPEG files are the only thing that WMP will display"
"Make the Now Playing window anything other than tiny, and it looks stupid.That itty bitty picture looks oh so foolishThe rationale for removing the Advanced Tag Editor was that it wasn't very good; that it didn't meet the quality standard set for Windows 7"
"While it's true that it wasn't very good, removing it without replacing it is equally not very good"
"Worse, in fact"
"Making the software completely unable to do something is inferior to doing something in a clumsy way.The integration with Libraries is far from perfect, too"
"Currently WMP is showing me files from two locations that haven't been in my Library for about a month"
"It is slowly sorting itself out, removing the missing files, but the process is far slower than it was in WMP11"
"What's more, it isn't even doing so consistently; some of the files from the old locations are gone, but other filesâ€”from the same folder, evenâ€”are still showing up"
"All of this represents a big omission relative to its predecessor"
"WMP11 had its own library concept, and it kept the library up-to-date through watching folders (oh how I wish iTunes could do the same)"
"Updates to the filesystem were reflected in the WMP11 library almost instantaneously"
"That's no longer the case with WMP12"
"Updates to the library do eventually make their way into WMP, but it's nowhere near as snappy.Drives E and I are not even attached to the system and have been removed from the LibraryThe only practical solution is to reset the library; this causes WMP12 to close (it's not clear why that should be necessary) and on restarting it rebuilds the entire database"
"Even this is a regression; WMP11 could rescan its folders without closing.Media Player has been visually refreshed; the over-the-top translucency of WMP11 has disappeared in favour of a more muted appearance"
"Various features have been rearranged, so nothing is in quite the same place as it used to be, and there are still some very questionable UI decisions"
"Though the menu bar is normally hidden from view, the application is still very much dependent on it for normal operations"
"If a UI element is essential (and the menu is) it shouldn't be mysteriously hidden away"
"The no-menu trend is becoming more widespread in Microsoft's software, and while I don't think it's a bad thing per se, it needs to be done properly"
"Internet Explorer and Explorer both hide their menu bars, but they provide access to the vast majority of the menu's features through other mechanisms; the few operations left in the menus are esoteric and rarely used"
"Hiding these makes no difference in normal usage; the same can't be said of WMP"
"The menus haven't been replaced by other UI devices, they're just hidden and obscured from view"
"This is dumb design.All in all, a frustrating experience.Media CenterMedia Center is a much more satisfying piece of software than WMP12"
"Whether or not it adds much new depends on what you compare it to"
"In 2008, Vista received a large update to Media Center named the Windows Media Center TV Pack 2008"
"This was unfortunately an OEM-only release; available for preinstallation on new machines, but not for existing Vista users"
"The TV Pack included support for a range of new TV standards including native QAM support, DVB-S, and MHEG-5 interactive content (a must-have in this country, as it allows hundreds of pounds of computer equipment to finally offer the same features as a 30 dollar set-top box)"
"It also raised the number of supported tuners to two of each kind (ATSC, QAM, DVB-T, etc.) in Home Premium, and four of each kind in Ultimate.As well as not being widely available (the installers are "out there" if you look for them, but it was not integrated into Service Pack 2 or anything like that) the TV Pack was reported to have issues with bugginess and stability.Windows 7 has all those things built-in, and adds the aforementioned H.264 support, enabling a broader range of HDTV to be played back"
"As with Media Player, it also integrates with Libraries, using them the source for music, videos, and so on.The look and feel has been refreshed, and overall feels quite a bit quicker"
"I might be imagining things, but MC on Vista always felt quite sluggish; my main Windows 7 machine is a lot slower than my main Vista PC, but Media Center certainly feels far snappier.Other appsThough some applications are no longer included, the time-honored Windows stalwarts, Paint, WordPad, and Calculator, are all still there, and all have shiny new versions in Windows 7"
"Paint and WordPad both incorporate a ribbon-based user interface"
"Their ribbons are similar to (but different from) the Office 2007 ribbon; the minor changes make the existence of the menu rather clearer"
"Paint is about as feature deficient as it's always been; its real novelty is as a multitouch showcase, as it allows multiple fingers to paint simultaneously"
"One good decision is that now it saves in PNG by default, in contrast to Vista's choice of JPEG and XP's of BMP.WordPad is considerably more useful, due to its new ability to both read and write Office Open XML .docx (Word 2007) files, and Open Office .odt files"
"Though obviously it does not support all of the features of these formats, the decision to support these standards makes it much more useful.In truth, neither WordPad nor Paint really makes full use of the ribbon; both have so few features that all their options would fit on a single screen with room to spare"
"The ribbon does look good, though, and importantly, the API for the ribbon is available to developers so that they can incorporate ribbons with an identical look and feel into their own applications"
"Best of all, the new ribbon API is also a part of the Platform Update for Windows Vista, meaning that developers will not be limiting themselves to Windows 7 by using the ribbon API"
"I hope that this decision yields fruit and results in more software (both first and third party) using the ribbon API when appropriate.Calculator's changes are also substantial"
"It has four distinct modes (Standard, Scientific, Programmer, and Statistics) as well as features for unit conversion, date arithmetic, mortgage payment calculations, and a few other things besides"
"It is about as fully-featured as can be expected from a non-programmable calculator"
"It still feels like some relic of the 1980s to use, though; while my cheapo Casio scientific calculator will let me press buttons in the order that I write (e.g"
""sin 30"), Calculator requires me to type backwards ("30 sin"), making the $10 device better than an entire PC"
"I hate it when that happens.Almost as good as a real calculator!Notepad, by the way, remains crap.EnterpriseDeploymentWindows 7 comes with a range of new features to improve manageability and security, and enterprise deployment of Windows 7 builds on the new features introduced with Vista"
"The image-based installation allows easy construction of custom system images, including the ability to deploy custom software packages as part of the image"
"Windows 7 has a new tool for managing images, namely DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management), a single command-line tool for manipulating deployment images.The images themselves can be either .WIM images (as used in Vista), or .VHD (as used in Virtual PC)"
"The ability to use VHD images allows the same image to be used across both virtual and physical hardware"
"Using a VHD with physical hardware depends on a new Windows 7 feature that allows direct booting from a VHD file; as a consequence, only Windows 7 (and Windows Server 2008 R2) can be deployed in this way"
"Manually deploying VHD images is surprisingly simple; install an image into the VHD and then add an entry for the VHD into the boot menu using bcdedit"
"They are also supported using the updated Windows Deployment Services found in Server 2008 R2.Vista greatly increased the ease with which installation images can be created, making it relatively simple to create install images that supported a wide range of hardware configurations; this was a nice contrast to previous Windows deployment processes, which tended to be much more restrictive due to HAL and boot driver concerns"
"Vista allowed the injection of arbitrary drivers into the install image, allowing it to be deployed onto hardware not supported by the base image; this capability has been extended through a feature called Dynamic Driver Provisioning"
"Dynamic Driver Provisioning allows drivers to be separated from images and stored centrally; in turn, this permits new drivers to be added without having to change the images, and means that deployed systems will contain only the drivers that they need, rather than every driver found in the image.Migration of existing user data during image deployment is also improved"
"The revised User State Migration Tool is smarter (it requires less configuration to do the right thing) and significantly faster, due to a new hardlink migration mode"
"This mode uses hard links (rather than file copies) to migrate user data from the old installation to the newly deployed one, providing deployments that are robust and rapid, yet non-destructive.Mobile workingTo the three VPN mechanisms found in Vista (the traditional PPTP and L2TP, and the new-in-Vista HTTP/SSL-based SSTP) Windows 7 adds not one, but two new ways of accessing a corporate network remotely: IKEv2 ("VPN Reconnect"), and DirectAccess"
"As with many other Windows 7 enterprise features, these require Windows Server 2008 R2 to be deployed.IKEv2 is a standards-based (RFCs 4306 and 4555, to be specific) protocol to securely authenticate remote users and create IPSec tunnels"
"As with L2TP, it depends on deployment of PKI, and as with L2TP it requires a range of ports and protocols to be available, which often won't be an option behind restrictive firewalls"
"However, it offers one key advantage that PPTP, L2TP, and SSTP do not: it allows the client to become temporarily disconnected from the server without interrupting the VPN connection"
"IKEv2 is thus much friendlier to mobile computers that might either have an unreliable network connection (e.g"
"mobile broadband) or might switch between network connections (e.g"
"moving from WiFi to an office LAN)"
"Though the client may be disconnected and change IP addresses, the VPN connection will transparently reconnect, thus minimizing interruption to any programs using the network.In mobile scenarios, this is a big advantage over the other VPN technologies"
"Non-IKEv2 tunnels all need to be manually re-established after disconnection, and the disconnection/reconnection procedure interrupts any current network activity"
"With IKEv2, network activity is merely suspended for the duration of the disconnection.The other new way of accessing a corporate network, DirectAccess, avoids VPNs entirely (which can only be a good thing)"
"DirectAccess uses globally routable IPv6 addresses and IPSec to provide direct, secure end-to-end connections between client and server"
"Unlike other VPNs, which require a kind of "dial-in", DirectAccess connects automatically and transparently; in fact, even prior to logging in, DirectAccess authenticates the machine with the remote network, allowing system policies and software updates to be rolled out.Obviously, IPv6 is not as abundant as perhaps it should be"
"DirectAccess can use the various transition technologies (ISATAP, Teredo, 6to4) as necessary, so even clients on IPv4 networks should have some ability to use DirectAccess"
"Nonetheless, it's something that will work better when IPv6 is ubiquitous"
"In an ideal world, technology like DirectAccess will spur on the deployment of IPv6; in reality, it'll probably just fall by the wayside, even though IPv4's days are numbered.For organizations with remote offices, the new BranchCache featureâ€”which yet again requires Server 2008 R2â€”should provide faster access to files hosted on SMB2 and HTTP servers"
"There are two modes of operation, a Hosted Cache mode, which places a caching fileserver in each branch office, and a Distributed Cache mode, which uses peer-to-peer transfers within the branch office to share cached files"
"Each time a client tries to retrieve a file from the server, it is sent a hashcode; it can then interrogate the local cache (whether P2P or a caching server) for that file"
"If the file is found locally, it is read from the cache; otherwise, the client downloads it from the remote server and then sends it to the caching server, or just makes it available to its local peers.The peer-to-peer mode is particularly desirable for small offices; they don't require any additional infrastructure, and require only minimal client configuration"
"In both modes, operation is largely transparent to the end-user software; the caching takes place automatically whenever SMB2 or HTTP is used.BranchCache has more than a superficial similarity to the existing DFS and DFS-R technology already in Windows"
"They do overlap"
"Broadly speaking, both can be used to provide high-speed access to intranet data in branch offices"
"The differences are in the details"
"BranchCache typically requires less hardware infrastructure (especially in Distributed Cache mode)"
"DFS supports SMB1 and SMB2 clients (including legacy operating systems); BranchCache supports SMB2 and HTTP/HTTPS clients, and no legacy operating systems.BranchCache will always give clients the latest version of the file, DFS will give them only the last-replicated version; similarly, BranchCache writes back changes to the source immediately, whereas DFS replicates them back according to schedule"
"Perhaps most significantly, DFS can operate even if the WAN link fails; because DFS stores a complete replica at the branch office, clients can use that replica transparently"
"BranchCache, on the other hand, makes no guarantee that files will be available in the branch office; moreover, before a file can be requested from the cache, the source server must be contacted"
"This means that if the WAN link goes down, so does BranchCache.AppLockerSoftware Restriction Policies are an effective and widely used mechanism for locking down Windows installations and permitting only specific applications to run"
"They're also extremely picky and something of a chore to administer"
"SRP uses file hashes to determine whether a program is permitted or not"
"The problem this causes is that it means any minor point release or bugfix is then blocked, making SRP clumsy enough to use that many don't bother.AppLocker, a new SRP-like technology, improves this situation"
"AppLocker allows policies to be set in a more flexible way"
"For example, a policy might say "Allow the program Acrobat Reader, as long as its publisher (verified by digital signature) is Adobe and the version is at least 9." Such a rule would allow deployment of bugfixes without any need to create new rules.The way AppLocker sits alongside SRP is somewhat odd"
"AppLocker is only found in the Enterprise and Ultimate versions"
"SRP is still supported, and support for SRP is also included in Professional"
"The two are somewhat mutually exclusive, too; if a GPO includes AppLocker rules and SRP rules, only the former will be applied.BitLocker To GoIt has become a popular pastime amongst government employees to load as much sensitive data as possible onto a laptop and then deposit that laptop in a public place so that someone can find it"
"This hobby has likely spread to the private sector too, although it attracts less attention there"
"There are many spoilsports out there who regard this as a poor use of resources; they argue that sensitive data should be kept out of the hands of thieves"
"To appease these meanies, Windows Vista's BitLocker feature enabled encryption of whole partitions, requiring a PIN or suitable USB key to decrypt them.However, the data-losers are an inventive bunch, and many of them have noticed that you can use removable media to lose data quite effectively, too"
"One solution has been to block the use of removable media entirely, but this is often a rather heavy-handed approach"
"Windows 7 provides an alternative; it supports the use of BitLocker on removable media, "BitLocker To Go." This supports USB flash drives, external hard disks, memory cards, and anything else that's NTFS, FAT, FAT32, or exFAT-formatted"
"The use of BitLocker To Go can further be mandated, to ensure that all removable media are secure"
"Unencrypted disks can still be read, but any attempts to write are blocked until secured.BitLocker To Go includes limited, read-only backwards compatibility with old operating systems when used in conjunction with FAT/FAT32/exFAT disks; Windows puts a small reader application on the disk that allows the disk to be read as long as suitable credentials are provided"
"This isn't the case with NTFS media, unfortunately"
"NTFS disks are not recognized by those OSes, and users will be instead prompted to format them, which is far from ideal.Other stuffThe Problem Steps Recorder should be a boon for helpdesks everywhere"
"This simple tool lets you make a recording of the steps required to reproduce a problem (yeah, I guess the clue was in the name)"
"The recording includes screenshots, system information, and optional annotations as necessary, and should do a good job of taking the guesswork out of supporting end-user problems.PowerShell 2.0 is installed as standard, which should in principle make it easier to write and use complex login scripts"
"PowerShell scripts can also be invoked remotely, allowing an administrator on a single PC to perform standard management actions on a set of PCs at once, or take specific action on a single remote machine.Offline Files, one of the things that makes me love my Windows laptop more than my MacBook Pro, has seen some refinements"
"Policies can now be applied to prevent, for example, MP3s from being synced"
"The offline file store can also now be used as a cache"
"Normally with Offline Files a PC with a network connection will still depend on the fileserver for all access to the file"
"If access to the fileserver is slow for whatever reason then so is access to the file"
"By enabling Transparent Caching through GPOs (it's not enabled by default), the client machine will use the local cache in preference to the network"
"To ensure the file is kept up-to-date the network still needs to be queried, but unless the file has been changed, no data will be transferred, making an excellent feature even better"
"By now you can probably guess which OS is required on the server for this capability.The new enterprise features are all pretty compelling"
"But there is a common refrain to many of them; they need Windows Server 2008 R2 to work"
"Most of the network-related features, including the improved deployment capabilities, won't work until the server infrastructure is updated in tandem"
"Is this a problem"
"Well, yes and no"
"Windows' enterprise features (GPOs, SRP, etc.) are already a cut above what other platforms offer, and none of them go away in Windows 7; it's still a good enterprise desktop platform, and it still offers benefits above and beyond its predecessors.But to really make it shine, you're going to want 2008 R2 on your servers"
"And that's no small upgrade, even if you're already on Server 2008; 2008 R2 is as different from 2008 as Windows 7 is from Vista, and includes some exasperating incompatibilities"
"Exchange 2007â€”which is still the current version for a few more weeksâ€”is not supported on 2008 R2"
"You'll have to wait for Exchange 2010.MultitouchThe very first Windows 7 feature to be demonstrated was multitouch"
"Back when it was demoed, it was underwhelming"
"And I don't have any multitouch input hardware myself, nor do I know anyone who does"
"If there is a niche for this then it is microscopic, just as the niche for tablet computing as a whole is microscopic"
"Windows 7 supports quite a few gestures"
"Some, like pinch zooming, should work transparently with existing applications, because they're mapped to pre-existing applications (pinch zooming is equivalent to holding down ctrl and using the scroll wheel on your mouse, and handled accordingly); others, such as rotation, are new concepts and will need specific application support"
"In any case, the built-in OS support is limited; multitouch isn't used by much.Touch interfaces are a curious thing"
"Microsoft has long had a fixation with tablet PCs, traditionally with single-touch screens, but now potentially with multitouch"
"It's just never been clear why"
"For a start, touch encompasses a few things"
"Some touch systems use fingers on a touchscreen; these are much cruder and imprecise, but offer the possibility of multitouch; they also allow direct manipulation of things on-screen, that is, where you touch the screen is significant, because it governs whether you're touching this object or that one"
"Some touch systems use a stylus; these allow quite fine control (though probably not as pixel-perfect as a mouse), and are particularly suited to tasks like handwriting or drawing"
"Typically, stylus-based input schemes don't really facilitate direct manipulation (since the stylus is used with a special pad rather than a screen), but sometimes (such as with some high-end tablets and most touchscreen cell phones) they do"
"And then we have systems like the touchpads Apple uses on their laptops, their new Magic Mouse, and the research prototypes shown recently by Redmond"
"(The latter makes you wonder, though"
"Why are they doing prototypes when Apple has a shipping product?) These offer pixel-accurate mousing and multitouch together, but they don't offer any kind of "direct manipulation;" the gestures can be performed anywhere on the multitouch surface and the effect is the same.Where touch works well, it's where the designer has picked one of these modes of operation and built their UI around it"
"The canonical example is, of course, the iPhone"
"This uses a finger-based touchscreen, and accordingly its UI is generally "direct;" where you touch the screen matters"
"Another widely-used example are the trackpads that Apple sticks in its laptops; because these are decoupled from the screen, the multitouch gestures can be made anywhere on the surface without changing their meaning or effect.Touch on Windows is much less well-defined"
"Microsoft tries to make it a bit of everything"
"So for example, Windows 7 has new and improved handwriting recognition, including support for mathematics; for stylus users these look pretty good (the math part especially), but if you have a touchscreen, they're useless"
"Still, stylus users normally have it easy, because they typically have a mouse too, for actually driving the OS"
"Touchscreen users also have some new thingsâ€”the aforementioned touch gestures, a new on-screen keyboard that supports multitouch (so the shift key works "properly")â€”but they still have to put up with an operating system that's fundamentally designed for something smaller than a finger"
"And using a touchscreen on a desktop PC is always going to be a horrible affair, as holding your arms out straight in front of you for prolonged periods simply isn't comfortable.So it's all a bit perplexing that Microsoft continues to do so much work in this area"
"Windows doesn't have the user interface or the applications for a finger-driven tablet machine"
"Touchscreen desktops are a non-starter due to being so hostile to their user, and touchscreen conventional laptops aren't much better"
"Maybe one day there will be a touch computer that justifies the use of touch, with a user interface to match, but that day is not today, and Windows' touch features are not advancing the state of the art.Minor featuresWindows 7 contains a surprising number of small improvements and features that may not be immediately useful today, but that enrich the platform for the future"
"For example, it introduces a standard driver model and API for what are termed "sensors;" any input device that tells the computer about its environment; for example, GPS to tell it where it is, accelerometers to tell it how it is oriented and moving, or light sensors to tell it about the ambient environment"
"This both simplifies development of sensor drivers, and exposes the hardware capabilities to software in a standard way"
"This also means that the operating system can govern access in a controlled way; for example, the user might choose to deny access to location sensors to anything except a mapping program.In a similar vein, biometric devices like fingerprint scanners also now have a standard driver model and API"
"This allows, among other things, more consistent integration of biometric security into the login and UAC screens (contrast this with XP, where any biometric device has to customize the login screen in its own unique and usually hideously ugly way), and again, allows management of biometric devices; GPOs can be used to enable or disable the use of biometric security.Finally, wireless broadband hardware similarly has a new, standard driver model"
"Using this model obviates the need for third-party software (and the management overhead that goes with it) in favor of using built-in capabilities.In all three of these cases, however, the benefits are at present substantially hypothetical, due to a lack of devices using the new APIs"
"I hope that vendors will do a speedy job of supporting the new OS, but I'm not confident; they aren't any under any compulsion to, as the existing drivers still work, and the existing drivers have the benefit of working in Vista and XP.Vista's already excellent Resource Monitor has become even more awesome and useful"
"New abilities include enumerating all the handles and DLLs that a process has open, and much more detailed network details, including showing the firewall status of listening ports.DNSSECWindows 7 adds new support for industry standards in the form of DNSSEC support"
"DNS infrastructureâ€”the system that turns names like "arstechnica.com" into IP addressesâ€”is vulnerable to a number of attacks, the most serious being that it can be spoofed: an attacker can inject fraudulent responses to DNS queries that enable him to effectively take over control of the domain name of his choosing"
"DNSSEC is an update to the DNS specifications that fixes these flaws"
"DNSSEC's development was tortuous, and its rollout onto global DNS servers has been equally slow"
"But it is, finally, beginning to happen, so software support is now a legitimate concern.Windows 7's DNS support doesn't actually validate DNSSEC dataâ€”it depends on the DNS server to do that (and guess which version of Windows Server you'll need if you want your Windows DNS server to validate DNSSEC...)â€”but it has been updated to tell DNS servers that it wants validation"
"If the DNS server attempts to validate the data and that validation fails, the Windows 7 DNS client will fail the attempt to resolve the name"
"It will still be some years before DNSSEC is widely used, but Windows is now ready for it.The indexing service that powers Windows search can now perform OCR of TIFF images"
"Though not enabled by default (due to resource usage constraints), installing it gives full-text searching of TIFFs"
"Scanned documents and faxes are the main target for this capability.Hitting Win+P provides a neat little tool for choosing how to handle an externally connected monitor on laptop systems; all four options (laptop only, mirroring, extending the desktop, external only) are available at the click of a button"
"This certainly beats messing around with Fn-key combinations and trying to decipher the consistently unclear icons on my keyboard.This sure beats the icons on my keyboardTroubleshootingTo help diagnose a range of common issuesâ€”missing network connectivity, sound failing to play, that kind of thingâ€”Windows has a new troubleshooting framework"
"Each troubleshooter examines the system and performs appropriate fixes to attempt to resolve any problems"
"The troubleshooters are based, behind the scenes, on PowerShell scripts"
"Updates will be offered through Windows Update, and it should be possible for third parties to write troubleshooters to resolve custom issues.There are many other small improvements scattered throughout the operating system that I've not mentioned; ClearType tuning is built in, display calibration is built in, listing WiFi networks is a little simpler, and so on and so forth"
"Many of these have been touched on in past Windows 7 coverage; in particular:Our first look at the new taskbar and why it isn't like the Mac OS X Dock.Our detailed look at the Windows 7 UI.WMP12 in detail.UAC changes and why they're not such a good idea.An introduction to Device Stage.Nonetheless, there are capabilities that I have not covered in this review; they all contribute to the positive experience of using Windows 7, but few have any great day-to-day impact, especially for those coming from Vista.Windows 7 versus Windows VistaThe big question is, does Windows 7 put right what Vista did wrong"
"Are the things that caused so much bad press for Vistaâ€”high system requirements, low performance, and poor compatibilityâ€”still a concern in 7?The answer is.."
"kinda"
"Let's take the easy ones first"
"Windows 7's disk footprint is smaller, and, with WDDM 1.1, its memory usage is lower"
"It's not a huge amount smaller, and you're still not going to want to run Windows 7 on machines with less than 1 GB RAM, but the new OS is a little more svelte than its predecessor.This svelteness appears to have had little impact on performance, though"
"Benchmarks indicate that 7 and Vista are pretty similar"
"But the benchmarks also show that they're pretty similar to Windows XP too, after all"
"Performance isn't the problem it was thought to be anyway.Compatibility is an altogether more complicated issue"
"Microsoft knew that compatibility was a problem in Vista, and sought to improve the situation with 7"
"To that end, Windows 7 does.."
"well.."
"almost nothing, actually, to make things fundamentally "better." Windows 7 is basically the same as Vista; its drivers are substantially the same, so its hardware compatibility is substantially the same; likewise, its software compatibility is nigh on identical to Vista's"
"For the most part, anything that worked in Vista will continue to work in Windows 7; anything that didn't work then probably won't work now.But of course, that is not telling the whole story"
"It's true that Microsoft did not roll back any of the major causes of trouble; UAC is still here, WDDM is still here, security is still allowed to trump backwards compatibility if necessary"
"The changes made in Vista were no accidents, and were necessary for the platform as a whole.What the new platform does do, however, is to make it easier to patch up broken applications so that they work properly"
"And for applications that can't be encouraged to work through duct-tape and baling wire, there is a new virtualization-based approach to running old software.The first approach leverages a capability that's been built into Windows for some years now; the ability to insert shims into misbehaving applications to perform minor fixes that change just enough to let the application work"
"A classic example of this is an application with a broken version check"
"Applications check the OS version for a number of reasons, typically to ensure that the OS is new enough that it contains some capability that the application depends on"
"All too often, however, applications check that the OS is exactly a specific version (i.e"
""has a major version of 5") when they should be checking that it is at least that version (i.e"
""has a major version greater than or equal to 5")"
"This is easily fixed by making the OS lie to the application about which version it is; Windows has a shim to do this very thing, along with many others"
"Windows has a compatibility database of which applications need what shims, and for dealing with minor incompatibilities they're highly effective.The compatibility database is periodically updated through Windows Update, and administrators have long had the ability to add their own entries to the database using the Application Compatibility Toolkit"
"Windows 7 adds a new option"
"If an application crashes twice in a row, a new feature called the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter (part of the new troubleshooting infrastructure) will start up and guide the user through selecting the right shims"
"The range of shims that this can configure is limited (the ACT lists many dozens; the automated tools will only use a handful), but for many common problems they should be sufficient.If this isn't enough to fix the problem app, it's time for virtualization, in Windows XP Mode"
"It's not really a "mode"â€”it's an XP SP3 VM running in the new Windows 7 version of Virtual PCâ€”but it should provide a solution to most remaining compatibility issues.I'm not going to go into it in much detail now; the final RTM version of Virtual PC and the Windows XP Mode system image weren't available at the time of writing (though they are out now), so a follow-up article will cover XP Mode in more detail"
"But in brief: the virtual machine is somewhat integrated into the host environment, so that programs installed in the compatibility environment can be invoked from the Start menu or launched via file extension associations, and moving data between the VM and the host environment is mostly seamless.So while Windows 7 may not right all of Vista's wrongs, it is absolutely superior to its predecessor"
"It has three years of improvements, so it can't help but be better"
"But if you hated Vista's UI, you're going to hate Windows 7's"
"Worse, in fact, because 7 forces you to use the new Start menu and taskbar, with no possibility of reverting to the old behaviour"
"If your applications didn't work in Vista, they almost certainly won't work in 7"
"Sure, 7 has some virtualization tools to help, but this was always possible in Vista too"
"If you felt Vista was too big and too slow, well, 7 isn't going to provide much joy there, either"
"Marginal improvements, perhaps, but nothing more"
"Everything "bad" about Vistaâ€”and I use the word in the loosest possible sense, because the things that garnered most complaints have negligible legitimacyâ€”is still "bad" in 7.Does this make Windows 7 a bad operating system"
"Not in the least bit"
"Windows Vista, for all its (alleged) flaws, was the best version of Windows ever shipped"
"The underlying changes it made were essential to the longevity of the Windows platform, and user features like the searchable Start menu remain an absolute joy that make XP look clunky and ancient in comparison"
"Windows 7 is even better than Vista, so XP holdouts should upgrade with confidence"
"Windows 7 is a great OS.For existing Vista users, the upgrade decision is a bit less clear-cut"
"Personally, I think it is worthwhile; I like the new taskbar, and that, in conjunction with the many small improvements like Resource Monitor, justifies the upgrade to me"
"If I were a heavy Media Center user stuck with the RTM Media Center, it would also be something of a no-brainer"
"But everyone else will have to weigh the pros and cons for themselves"
"Due to Microsoft's decision to backport D3D11 and related technology to Vista, you don't lose that much by not upgrading.Overall, it's pretty clear that Windows 7 is "Vista R2." Hell, the branding of the server counterpart is a dead giveaway here"
"Windows Server 2008 RTM was exactly Vista SP1; Windows Server 2008 R2 is exactly Windows 7"
"Why does one retain its branding but not the other"
"Because the Windows Server 2008 branding is popular and successful (the OS was, quite rightly, very well-received) in a way that the Vista branding is not"
"If Vista had gotten the reception it actually deserved, and become a brand worth keeping, it seems highly likely that the name would have been retained"
"And Microsoft knows it, which is why internally, Windows 7 is only version 6.1"
"Sure, the company has made specious claims that this is to avoid breaking applications with bad version checks, but the logic doesn't really hold; many of those applications are just as broken by "6" as they would be by "7," and if that were such a concern then the minor version wouldn't change either.But at the end of the day, that doesn't really matter"
"Windows 7 is, overall, a fantastic OS"
"It builds on a solid platform, and just makes it even better.For the Windows faithful, itâ€™s been a tough eight years"
"With the launch of Windows XP in 2001, we thought we were poised on a brink of a new world of NT-based goodnessâ€”but two years and uncountable exploits later, the future of Windows was grim"
"Facing a never-ending torrent of new â€˜sploits, worms, and trojans, Microsoft fired back with the single greatest operating system update of all timeâ€”Service Pack 2"
"In the single fell swoop of SP2, Windows XP went from Swiss cheese to secure, and once again we were poised to enter the promised land withâ€¦ (wait for it)â€¦ Vista.Of course, we all know how Vista turned out"
"Haunted by poor performance in everything from games to disk access to networking, Vista is widely considered to be Microsoftâ€™s biggest failure"
"Nonetheless, Vista laid the groundwork for a host of new technologies, all absolutely vital to pushing Windows into the 21st century"
"Vistaâ€™s new, modern driver architecture was designed to move core functionality from the kernel (where any instability can bring down the whole system) to user spaceâ€”an absolutely necessary development"
"Likewise, Vistaâ€™s proper enforcement of permissions for both users and applications enhanced security, even though UAC remains very annoying"
"And once vendors fixed their driver flaws and Microsoft squashed some underlying bugs, Vista morphed into an entirely workable operating system, even if we still wouldnâ€™t describe it as â€œgood.â€?So, as 2009 draws to a close, we find ourselves testing another new Microsoft OS: Windows 7"
"Building on the now-mature technologies introduced with Vista, but with a renewed focus on performance and ease-of-use, Windows 7 seems poised to succeed where Vista couldnâ€™t"
"Weâ€™ve finally received a final build of Win7, and have run it through the wringer in both the Lab and in the real-world"
"Hereâ€™s what we found"

"Weâ€™ve finally received a final build of Win7, and have run it through the wringer in both the Lab and in the real-world"
"Hereâ€™s what we found.New FeaturesWhile support for new hardware and improved security are perfectly valid reasons to upgrade your OS, the sexiest benefits of an operating system upgrade are all the new features"
"Indeed, from a completely revamped user interface to brand-new features designed to make organizing and sharing your files easier, Windows 7 delivers much more than some new wallpaper and a different color Taskbar"
"(Though there are lots of new wallpapers.)User Interface EnhancementsThe most obvious changes from previous versions of Windows to Windows 7 can be found in a redesigned user interface"
"Sure, much of the interface remains the same, but Microsoft has completely overhauled key elements, starting with the Taskbar.The New TaskbarAfter 14 years of nothing more than cosmetic changes, Microsoftâ€™s redesign of the Taskbar combines the pure window organizing power of the classic Taskbar with the application-launching, multi-purpose convenience of Mac OS Xâ€™s Dock"
"In addition to showing the applications that you currently have open, the new Windows 7 Taskbar also hosts shortcuts to your most commonly used applications"
"Click a shortcut when the app is running, and it brings the most recently used window to the foreground"
"Click the same shortcut when the app is closed, and it will launch the app.But thatâ€™s not all"
"Drag a file onto a shortcut in the Taskbar, and Windows will open the file using that app"
"Hover your mouse over a running applicationâ€™s icon, and it expands to show live thumbnail previews of all of that appâ€™s windows, floating just above the Taskbar"
"Mouse over a thumbnail, and Windows will bring that particular window to the foreground"
"You can even close individual windows from the thumbnail previews.For anyone who regularly finds himself with more than 10 windows open, the new Taskbar is a dream come true.Jump ListsAnother core enhancement to the OS comes in the form of Jump Lists"
"In short, Jump Lists put frequently used files in a convenient menu thatâ€™s a simple click away from the shortcut icon on the Taskbar or on the Start Menu"
"Apps that support Jump Lists will display the list when you right click on the shortcut, or when you left-click and drag the mouse up away from the Taskbar"
"Additionally, some apps will automatically populate their Jump List with files you recently opened.New ShortcutsAlong with the redesigned UI elements comes a whole new world of user-interface shortcuts"
"There are really too many to get into here, but the best of the new shortcuts allow you to maximize a window by dragging it to the top of the screen, minimize it by dragging it to the bottom, maximize to half your screen by dragging it to either edge, or (our favorite) minimizing all other windows by shaking the one you want to focus on"
"Furthermore, enhancements to alt+tab let you immediately find lost windows, and you can use the Windows key and numbers 1 through 0 to launch the first ten shortcuts on your Taskbar"
"And when those apps are already open, you can cycle through multiple windows by pressing the appâ€™s keyboard shortcut again.Explorer EnhancementsWindows Explorer also receives some much-needed love"
"The changes since Vista are relatively minor, but they serve to make the left-column of Explorer the quickest way to navigate to any folder on your hard drive, network, or even in the cloud"
"Furthermore, you can arrange the different categories in any way you want, quickly add special folders to the Favorites section, and even hide sections you donâ€™t use.The other main place to access the file browser is the shortcut bar on the right column of the Start Menu"
"In Windows 7, there are more folders that you can choose to display there, including Downloads and Recorded TV"
"However, you still canâ€™t place any folder you choose in one of those precious slots.We Hope You Like the RibbonThe controversial Ribbon, which replaced traditional menus and shortcut bars in Office 2007, is prominently featured in Windows 7"
"In the applets that ship with the OS, youâ€™ll see the Ribbon featured prominently.LibrariesThe other major new Explorer feature is Libraries"
"Libraries are simply data buckets (for lack of a better term) that can store content thatâ€™s similar in nature, but located in different places on the same computer, across a network, or in the cloud"
"Libraries are handy for organizing and collecting files in one place, because they appear to be normal folders to most applications.For example, suppose your music is stored in the Music folder on your profile, but your wifeâ€™s music is stored in the Music folder in her profile"
"If you want to stream both collections of music using some sort of streaming software, you can either point it to both folder, or you could create a Library that includes both folders and then point your streaming application to that Library"
"Libraries become especially useful when you integrate them with your commonly used folders, network shares, and cloud services.DirectX 11The latest version of DirectX is more iterative than revolutionary, at least as far as gaming is concerned"
"However, it does bring some exciting new technology to Windows in the form of the general-purpose GPU computing API known as DirectX Compute.GamingThere are three important things to know about DirectX 11 if youâ€™re a gamer"
"First, DirectX 11 is coming to Vista and Windows 7, but not XP"
"Second, DirectX 11 is backwards-compatible with DirectX 10-capable videocards, so games that require the new API will still run on older GPUs, although those older GPUs arenâ€™t necessarily going to perform well"
"Third and finally, the feature likely to have the largest impact the soonest in DirectX 11 is hardware tessellation"
"Tessellation lets the GPU automatically fill in detail on certain types of meshes by procedurally generating more complex (and better looking) triangles to fill in the gaps in the source art"
"The upshot is simple: Objects that are curved will look better when you render them on a PC equipped with a DirectX 11-capable GPU"
"There are other DirectX 11 improvements that will enhance performance on DirectX 11 GPUs, but we donâ€™t anticipate a visual leap on par with the jump from DirectX 9 to DirectX 10.Compute Shaders: CPU-Like FunctionalityGeneral-purpose GPU computing (GP-GPU) allows developersâ€”specifically, those outside of the gaming arena--to take advantage of the performance potential of todayâ€™s modern, massively parallel GPUs"
"Tasks like rendering frames of animated movies, converting RAW photos to TIFFs, encoding H.264 video, and scrubbing video can all be accelerated using GP-GPU technology.Until recently, in order to take advantage of the computing power of your videocard, you needed to use apps that were specifically coded for the brand of GPU you owned"
"DirectX Compute (along with the competing OpenCL) aims to change that by providing a common interface for harnessing the power of whatever processors are in your system, be they from AMD, Intel, or Nvidia.It remains to be seen which GP-GPU API developers will embrace, but the future for the technology is bright.The HomeGroup Since home networks first became commonplace, weâ€™ve heard promises about Microsoft making the home networking experience better, easier, faster and safer"
"These are admirable goals, but connecting to a network share has been essentially unchanged since the days of Windows NT 4"
"Enter Windows 7"
"Now, instead of haplessly navigating a maze of permissions, share settings, and firewall boondoggles, if you want to share your files or printer with other networked PCs, you simply join a HomeGroup"
"And itâ€™s as easy as typing in a password"
"Once youâ€™ve created your HomeGroup, sharing files is as easy as right-clicking on a folder or file, clicking Share With, and selecting the option you want"
"You can exclude individual files or folders the same way.The only complaint we have with HomeGroups concerns compatibility: Neither earlier versions of Windows nor Windows Home Server machines can join HomeGroups today"
"TouchWhile Tablet PCs have been around for the better part of a decade now, Windows 7 is the first edition of the mainstream Windows OS to actively support touch"
"We havenâ€™t had the opportunity to test it, because the hardware support is limited right now, but the OS will work with common touch and multi-touch gestures on machines equipped with the appropriate hardware and software.What Isnâ€™t In Windows 7For the first time that we can remember, Microsoft has removed functionality from Windows"
"In Windows 7, previously core applets like Windows Movie Maker, Windows Photo Gallery, and Windows Mail are no longer part of the core OS"
"Instead, theyâ€™re part of a separate, optional download called Windows Live Essentials"
"We werenâ€™t huge fans of these apps when they were part of the OS, and we donâ€™t miss them now that theyâ€™re gone.Improvements from Windows Vista and XPIn addition to shiny new features, many legacy features from Vista and XP have been tweaked, touched up, or otherwise improved upon.Searching Is FundamentalVista was the first Windows version to have deep search features built right in"
"Does anyone use them"
"Not enough people do, and so our best advice we can give to the new Windows 7 user is to embrace search"
"As in Vista, you can use search to launch apps without removing your hands from the keyboard, to find specific settings in the control panel, and to parse through your email, document folders, and even shared folders on your network"
"Getting started with search is easyâ€”just mash the Windows key on your keyboard and type your query"
"The Windows 7 search is speedier than Vistaâ€™s was at launch, and finally allows searching of network shares, assuming theyâ€™re part of either your HomeGroup or indexed on the server side.Better UACUser Account Control was one of the most maligned new features to appear in Vista, and for good reason"
"We have all been extremely annoyed by UACâ€™s incessant prompts for permission to do anything that requires administrator access"
"Worse yet, sometimes Vista will prompt multiple times for the same action"
"All that said, UAC has produced Microsoftâ€™s desired effect: In situations where malware has infected Vista PCs, UAC helps contain those infections to a limited portion of the hard drive, typically a single user profile.In Windows 7, Microsoft exposes multiple levels of UAC notification control, and has greatly toned down the number of notifications youâ€™ll typically see"
"Whether you want granular control over the actions of each and every application you install, or simply opt not be bothered, you can choose the setting thatâ€™s right for you.UI SpeedMany of the behind-the-scenes improvements to Windows 7 were designed to do one thing: improve the responsiveness of the user interface"
"Whether itâ€™s the result of core kernel improvements that boost the performance of multi-threaded apps on multi-core CPUs, or improvements in the way frequently used applications are cached in memory, the new OS feels snappier in almost every way"
"Apps seem to load faster, and dialog boxes appear and disappear faster"
"In general, we found ourselves spending less time waiting for the PC than we do in XP, Vista, or OS X"
"While we attempted to measure some quantitative benchmarks on app load times and other UI speed tests, we found it very difficult to measure reliably"
"However, when surveying dozens of users about their Windows 7 experiences, one response was almost universal: Windows 7 feels faster.WallpapersIt seems a little goofy to talk about, but Windows 7 includes more awesome desktop wallpapers than any version of Windows weâ€™ve ever tested"
"The included window dressing ranges from the standard plain-vanilla Windows logo background to awesome, inspired, and downright creepy images created by artists from around the globe"
"Windows 7 also includes a utility that automatically swaps your wallpaper at fixed intervals"
"Still missing, however, is a way to run different backgrounds on multiple monitor rigs.AudioWe also have to give a nod to the polish that Microsoft gave to the audio control panel"
"Windows 7 handles multiple audio outputs much better than previous iterations of the OS, allowing you to designate your headphone output to communications software, while using your speakers for everything else"
"The OS will even detect when youâ€™re using voice chat software, and automatically mute or lower the volume on other sound sources"
"We had some problems with games that included voice chat functionality triggering this feature, but it was relatively easy to fix.Like Vista, Windows 7 lacks the APIs required to support older DirectSound 3D games"
"With most modern titles supporting OpenAL (which does work on Windows 7), the omission of 3D hardware sound support is more forgivable this go â€™round than it was with Vista.But itâ€™s still not something weâ€™re happy about.Versions, Activation and 64-bitLike Windows Vista, there are many versions of Windows 7 available"
"However, unless youâ€™re an IT guy at a big company, you really only need to be concerned with four different editions: Starter, Home Premium, Professional, and Ultimate"
"Yes, Microsoft has simplified the different versions of Windows that are available, but choosing the best OS for your needs still isnâ€™t effortless.The easiest way to look at the Windows 7 product family is to recognize that each version is superset of the version beneath it"
"For example, Home Premium includes all the features of Starter, but adds the Aero interface and Media Center"
"Professional, meanwhile includes all the features of Home Premium (and thus Starter), but a few features oriented toward business users.Now, with that said, there are really only a few core features that would demand you buy one version over another.For example, the main difference between Windows 7 Home Premium and Windows 7 Professional is that Pro includes the virtualized XP compatibility mode, the ability to back up your computer to a network drive, a Remote Desktop Connection server, and the ability to connect to corporate networks"
"Ultimate, meanwhile, includes all the features of Home Premium and Professional, but adds support for Bit locker drive encryption and the freedom to switch the OS between different languages.So which version should you buy"
"We recommend that most home users buy Home Premium, unless you either run a domain controller inside your home, or you want to be able to use Remote Desktop to log into your computer from another PC"
"Once you choose your OS, you can be secure in the knowledge that each successively more advanced version includes all the features included in simpler versions.Software activation continues to be a hassle for people who purchase Windows 7"
"We didnâ€™t complain when Microsoft launched Windows XP, but we have grown increasingly irked the unnecessary hassles it creates"
"For example, upgrading a hard drive or videocard frequently requires a call to Microsoftâ€™s phone activation line"
"While we recognize that Microsoft must protect its OS against piracy, weâ€™re not fans of any anti-piracy technology that inconveniences paying customers more than the pirates that itâ€™s designed to thwart.Our final thought on Windows 7 SKUs concerns the eternal debate between 32-bit and 64-bit support"
"The debate is essentially moot, as all retail versions of Windows 7 include both 32-bit and 64-bit discs"
"Whatâ€™s more, your activation key for Windows 7 is good for either a 32-bit install or a 64-bit install, so you can try out whichever version youâ€™d like, without worrying that youâ€™re locking yourself into a version of Windows that you may not want"
"That said, weâ€™ll be running 64-bit Windows 7 on our machines, and expect most enthusiasts to do the same.PerformanceTo assess Windows 7 performance, we spent more than 30 hours testing Windows 7 Professional x64 in a battery of benchmarks designed to measure application performance, network performance, disk performance, and finally, gaming"
"Our test rig was equipped with a Intel Core 2 Quad Q9770 Extreme processor, 4GB of DDR2 memory, a 1TB Barracuda 7200.12 drive, and an ATI Radeon 4890 videocard"
"To test gaming performance with both the ATI and Nvidiaâ€™s drivers, we used a manufacturer-overclocked GeForce GTX 285.ApplicationsAs you can see in our application benchmark chart, we saw wildly varying performance of different applications in Windows 7 x64, Windows XP x86 with Service Pack 3, and Windows Vista x64 with Service Pack 2"
"A few things really stood out, though"
"First, it seems that the hard drive performance problems that plagued early editions of Vista are solved once and for all in Windows 7"
"In our tests, Windows 7 was a few percent slower than XP SP3, but faster than Vista SP2.APPLICATION BENCHMARKSWindows XP (x86)	Windows Vista (x64)	Windows 7 (x64)	Percentage Difference: XP to Win 7	Percentage Difference: Vista to Win 7ProShow Producer (sec)"

"For gamers, especially those currently using Windows XP, thereâ€™s a strong reason to upgrade to Windows 7"
"You may sacrifice a little performance in some games, but youâ€™ll gain some in others, and youâ€™ll have the ability to run DirectX 10 and 11 apps in their full glory, which will never be possible in Windows XP"
"Weâ€™re also confident that both ATI and Nvidia will continuously work to improve gaming performance in the future, as both companies have for every other new OS Microsoft has released.The VerdictWhether youâ€™re coming from XP or Vista, Windows 7 offers a massive leap forward in usability, security, and support for new hardware and technology, especially for enthusiasts and power users"
"For anyone who regularly keeps many windows open at once time, the new Taskbar is worth the price of admission alone"
"For XP users, the security improvements are equally worthy of praise, while Vista users will be thrilled with the much improved, much less annoying UAC"
"Add in support for new hardware technologies, more new features, and the kernel improvements that should allow you to get more from your multi-core CPU, and Windows 7 becomes a tidy, compelling package to all Windows users.Best of all, the new OS simply feels faster than Vista or even XP"
"As one editor said after a session testing the OS, itâ€™s the best of both worldsâ€”the user interface speed of XP and the features and security of Vista and more"
"Thatâ€™s something to be lauded.Weâ€™re happy with the changes Microsoft has made to Windows 7 as a product line"
"By making the more expensive SKUs supersets of the less capable versions, choosing the right version of Windows 7 is as simple as it was picking a version of XP (and exponentially easier than navigating the almost incomprehensible SKU structure for Vista)"
"However, we still donâ€™t see any benefit to Microsoft fielding more than two SKUs of Windowsâ€”without Aero, Starter edition is unnecessarily crippled, as it was with Vista"
"Who should buy Ultimate"
"In our eyes, no one should, unless you desperately need multiple language support in the UI"
"As with Vista, the extras in Ultimate donâ€™t justify the added cost"
"For most of our users, weâ€™ll simply recommend Windows 7 Professional if you need to connect to a domain or use XP mode, and Home Premium if you donâ€™t.As with Vista and XP before it, we remain unhappy with the activation process"
"As enthusiasts who frequently upgrade hardware and reinstall our operating systems, weâ€™re tired of being punished with increasingly obnoxious reactivation processes"
"As paying customers, we shouldnâ€™t have to get on the phone every time we need to reinstall Windows, whether our behavior triggers piracy flags or not"
"The music industry has already figured out that the best way to drive your paying customers to thievery is to treat them like thieves"
"Hopefully, Microsoft will get the memo between now and the launch of Windows 8.Moral objections to product activation aside, Windows 7 is unquestionably the best version of Windows that Microsoft has ever released, and is the true successor to Windows XP"
"If youâ€™re an enthusiast or power user, Windows 7 is well worth your money, whether for an upgrade today or on your next new machine.We expect that this new OS will mark the beginning of the end for Windows XP, which is highest praise we can give the latest version of Windows.Here comes Windows 7, nearly three years after Windows Vista and eight years after Windows XP"
"By most accounts, Windows 7 is what Vista should have been"
"Do we finally have a worthy successor to XP"
"PROS: - Fast startup and performance - Stable - Nice aesthetic and functional changes to the desktop - Improved networking, power management & security - 32-bit & 64-bit versions included - Windows Media Center - Windows XP Mode (Professional & Ultimate only) CONS: - User Account Control still annoying - Upgrade can be challenging - Expensive There are only two Microsoft operating systems I've personally skipped since DOS 6.x-- Windows ME and Windows Vista"
"Windows ME was so terrible that PC World coined it the "Mistake Edition." Vista, when initially released, was considered to be bloated, relying on higher hardware requirements than XP, while being outperformed by XP on identical hardware"
"With Microsoft fast-tracking Windows 7, I decided to skip Vista altogether and upgrade to 7"
"This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS"
"PERFORMANCE & STABILITY One of the welcome enhancements Microsoft made was start-up time"
"The shutdown time has been improved as well"
"Also, in my non-benchmarked experience, Windows 7 has been at least as fast as XP if not faster"
"The kernel changes and ability to run the 64-bit version probably has a lot to do with that"
"Most benchmarks from around the Internet seem to support my observations"
"64-BIT I am elated to finally upgrade to a 64-bit operating system in order to take advantage of more memory support and modern processors"
"I have Intel Core 2 Duo processors in both my systems with 4GB of physical RAM but XP only allowed 3.25GB for system use"
"DESKTOP At first login, you'll notice the changes to the taskbar"
"The taskbar is no longer just a place to store quick launch icons and view open windows"
"It now provides functionality in the form of Jump Lists, which allow you to select your most frequently opened files or links from the apps you have "pinned" on the taskbar"
"The clock and calendar are improved and the Show Desktop icon is now integrated in the far right corner"
"Other desktop enhancements include Aero Peek, Aero Shake, Snap, new themes and wallpapers"
"You also get gadget support"
"All of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience"
"LIBRARIES Windows 7 introduces a new feature called libraries"
"Previously, your system had shortcuts to My Documents, My Music, My Pictures, etc"
"which had files residing in only those specific folders"
"Files can now reside anywhere on your system and be organized inside libraries"
"It's similar to how many music and photo applications organize files"
"NETWORKING Even as good as XP was, networking was cumbersome"
"Windows 7 makes connecting two or more Windows 7 systems together easy, using HomeGroup"
"This enables easy sharing of files and devices"
"One downside is that HomeGroup is only supported between Windows 7 systems"
"File transfer performance between computers has been vastly improved and connecting to a wireless network has never been easier on a Windows machine"
"SECURITY Security in Windows 7 is good and comes with Windows Firewall and Defender"
"Still, you'll probably want to invest in a more comprehensive Internet security suite, like Norton Internet Security 2010 or Kaspersky Internet Security"
"User Account Control (UAC) has been tweaked in order to give user accounts more flexibility in controlling their own security as well as providing more detailed information so the user can make better decisions about whether to allow certain actions"
"Coming from XP however, it is still annoying and I choose to turn it off"
"Also, in Windows 7 Ultimate, you can encrypt entire hard drives as well as external portable storage devices, like USB thumb drives"
"Though this is a welcome integrated feature, much of the functionality can be found in a popular open-source program called TrueCrypt"
"If you want encryption but not multi-language support, you could just get Windows 7 Home Premium and use TrueCrypt"
"POWER MANAGEMENT Power management has been improved overall and you should be able to squeeze more battery life out of your laptop, even when using your DVD drive"
"Sleep and resume has also been improved"
"XP wasn't always consistent when entering or resuming from sleep mode, but Windows 7 has been perfect"
"WINDOWS MEDIA CENTER I've only briefly played around with WMC but it looks promising"
"It has some fun options for media, especially when you're connected to the Internet"
"It may even be an adequate replacement for component DVR's should you choose to use it as the centerpiece to your entertainment center"
"The biggest advantage for me is that Windows 7 now includes a DVD decoder"
"This means that I can now watch DVD's natively"
"WMC is available in all Windows 7 editions except Starter"
"WINDOWS XP MODE For applications that ran in XP, but won't on 7, there is now XP Mode"
"It isn't perfect and your system has to have virtualization support and turned on"
"Go to your system BIOS to check"
"If supported, then install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode"
"Check your hardware if you intend to use XP Mode"
"XP Mode is only available in Windows 7 Professional and Windows 7 Ultimate editions"
"RECOMMENDATIONS If you're an XP holdout, like I was, I recommend upgrading"
"Vista SP2 users may have less reason to upgrade but might want to just for the changes to the taskbar and the UAC improvements"
"For users who don't need to use their computers in a corporate environment, then Windows 7 Home Premium edition is a good choice"
"I'm guessing most power users will choose Professional, which adds XP Mode and Domain Join"
"Ultimate also adds drive encryption and multi-language support"
"I suggest a clean install for best results"
"If you're a Mac OS X user, there is probably nothing in Windows 7 compelling enough for you to consider switching"
"SUMMARY Windows 7 is the premium Microsoft OS that Windows users have been waiting for"
"It's fast, secure, stable, visually appealing and fun to use"
"Windows 7 will make your old system feel fresh and new again"
"New system owners with Windows 7 pre-loaded can feel confident that they're getting the best Windows OS ever produced.I'll admit, I've been running Windows 7 for six months now: the preproduction version of it and have just upgraded to the gold code"
"So I have quite a bit of experience with the operating system"
"Let's get to the nitty gritty: Should you upgrade from Windows Vista"
"YES"
"I mean it - upgrade today"
"Windows 7 is quite simply faster, more stable, boots faster, goes to sleep faster, comes back from sleep faster, manages your files better and on top of that it's beautiful to look at and easy to use"
"Even the preproduction version of Windows 7 was better than my Vista with SP2"
"Should you upgrade from Windows XP"
"Maybe, but for different reasons"
"XP is a good operating system and if you don't need to add new hardware or software, XP is good"
"However, XP is old as an operating system"
"Also chances are that if you're running XP, you might not meet the minimum requirements for Windows 7 - check the compatibility site at Microsoft to see if your system will support Windows 7"
"That said, Windows 7 is light years ahead of Windows XP in terms of functionality, ease of use, etc - to me it's worth buying a new system"
"64 bit or 32 bit"
"If you don't know what I'm talking about, that's ok skip this section"
"If you have a core2 duo or core 2 quad or a multi cpu machine, go with the 64 bit OS, it handles memory and the CPUs much better"
"If you have a single core CPU, one CPU or run special programs that require 32bit, then stick with 32 bit for now"
"BEFORE INSTALLATION: I recommend you have: -a core 2 duo or core 2 quad machine -4gig of RAM (That's about $50 in today's market) -good hard drive with (200 gig - it doesn't need that much but that's another $50) -back up your files to a USB drive like Western Digital My Passport Essential 500 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive WDME5000TN (Midnight Black) -check to make sure your computer is compatible with Windows 7 INSTALLATION: Installation was very straight forward"
"You put in the CD and reboot your machine"
"You might have to enter your bios and enable the "boot from CD" option"
"Once the machine reboots a nice screen comes up to guide you through the installation"
"You have the option to upgrade your PC or do a clean installation"
"I did an upgrade and it brought in all of my files and settings from my windows Vista system"
"It worked great"
"The upgrade did take about 2 hours for me so definitely consider"
"I noticed that early on in the installation the operating system went out to Microsoft's site to look for the latest and greatest updates, so I think this should help Microsoft respond quickly to any hiccups with compatibility"
"WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The driver from my old HP Inkjet printer for 2001 doesn't work on Windows 7 so there are some things that will not transition"
"I had to use a generic HP driver which doesn't give me the quality that I got from an injet - so overall, I'm up and running with that printer but I'm degraded on the inkjet front"
"That said, I recently upgraded to a HP CP2025DN Color LaserJet Printer that I love so no real loss there"
"I'll likely pick up a cheap inkjet for the occasional photo that I might need to print"
"Everything else upgraded"
"BENEFITS -faster boot time -faster go to sleep -faster wakeup -faster about 20% to 30% faster at running applications than my Vista - seriously (but those are my results without any benchmarks or anything like that, just seeing how fast Adobe Illustrator loads, and how fast all the applications respond) -joining wireless networks is much easier -the interface is just plain beautiful -my wallpapers are now a slideshow that can be set to change every few minutes (I'm not stuck with the same picture) -Gadgets - these are wonderful little small applications that you can drag onto your desktop"
"I have a weather gadget and a calendar gadget on my desktop that tell me -Better taskbar management - hovering over the taskbar icons shows me mini windows of what's running -Better file management - I can organize my files into Libraries that are sortable not only by type but by folder or other data"
"It's great"
"I can browse through my presentations or illustrator files"
"-Windows Media appears to be smoother which I love"
"-You get some virus protection and firewall with Windows 7 but consider something more comprehensive like McAfee Total Protection 3User 2010"
"Yes, it'll make your computer run a bit slower but CONS: - Some older programs might not work and some drivers might not be available like my inkjet driver"
"- Other than that, there aren't too many drawbacks to Windows 7 - it's a great OS"
"WHICH VERSION SHOULD I GET"
"I got the ultimate version because I have clients who ask, "is your hard drive encrypted?" -- I wanted to be able to say yes and have sensitive data encrypted one of my computer volumes - Bitlocker is only available in the Ultimate version"
"Ultimate also includes Multilanguage support.If you're a home user that doesn't do a lot of networking, you might consider just the home premium edition"
"If you're using a laptop and connect to networks at work, you might want the Professional version of the operating system to help you with domain joining"
"Also Windows Professional gives you the option to run applications in XP mode so if you have old applications you can use that nifty feature"
"I already have 1 application running in XP mode - it's nifty to run an old application"
"NOTE: The box contains both the 32 bit and 64 bit OS"
"OVERALL: It's very hard to write a comprehensive review on an entire operating system so I didn't even try - I'm sure magazines will devote entire articles to the operating system and several books will come out"
"My goal here is just to give everyone a glimpse of what I've found to date with this new OS"
"I do hope this has helped you in making a decision"
"Hats off to Microsoft on Windows 7"
"It's more of a refined Windows Vista than an entirely new operating system but it was needed"
"Thank you.I've been using Windows 7 since its beta release, but my laptop's been running the final version for weeks now"
"I really disliked Vista and preferred XP still, but Windows 7 has tipped the scales...finally"
"Windows 7 has been reliable and it's snappier than Vista"
"Windows 7 sips laptop battery power so my 1-year-old Dell XPS M1530 runs longer under Win7 than it did under Vista"
"But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers"
"Here's a list of my favorites: #1 VIRTUAL LIBRARIES With virtual libraries, the special folders like Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos have all become libraries"
"Instead of being a physical storage location, they're indexes that point to one or many locations on the computer you're using, as well as other computers you're networked with"
"In a home setting, where you're running Windows Home Server, you can now easily direct file stores to your server"
"Also in the home, housemates can easily see each others' data by including their respective folders in one another's libraries"
"When you search a library, you're searching your computer and any other computer that has folders you've added to your library"
"You determine which physical location will be the default location for saving new files to your library"
"This is, for me, the single best feature of Windows 7, and is an excellent reason to upgrade"
"#2 START SEARCH The Start Search has been improved in Windows 7 so results appear instantly as soon as you click the Start button, and then either type the name of a program on your computer, or a task you'd like to perform (like, "change my display settings")"
"No more hunting folder hierarchies to find that elusive program, or spend time figuring out where Microsoft has placed something in the Control Panel"
"This is a tremendous time-saver"
"#3 AERO SNAP The Aero user interface has three new tricks -- Shake, Peek, and Snap -- but only Aero Snap is a major leap forward"
"Have you ever tried comparing the contents of two windows together, side-by-side"
"It's painful to do because you have to fiddle with resizing the two windows"
"With Aero Snap, now all you do is grab the title bar of one window, sling it to the left, and Windows 7 will automatically resize the window to fill-up one-half of your screen display"
"Do the same with a 2nd window by slinging it to the right, and it'll fill-up the right-side of your display"
"You can start comparing two windows in...an Aero Snap"
"Aero Shake and Peek are cute, but not nearly so helpful"
"#4 TASKBAR Gone is the Quick Launch bar that too many people didn't know existed"
"Now, the whole Taskbar is a quick launch bar -- drag and drop any program icon onto the bar, and you're one click away from starting the program"
"Also, it's so easy to move the taskbar around now"
"I keep it on the left vertical on my computer"
"Gone is the system tray, too -- Notification Area takes its place"
"The Action Center alerts you to anything you need to do to keep your computer working smoothly"
"#5 PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY Any program can be run in one of many compatibility modes now"
"Windows 7 has a wizard that will help you pick the right, earlier version of Windows under which to run an older program -- just right-click on the program icon and choose "Troubleshoot Compatibility""
"Or, You can do the same thing more quickly by right-clicking on a program icon, click the Compatibility tab, enable Compatibility mode, and select the earlier version of Windows you want to run with your program"
"#6 STICKY NOTES Less functional that the Vista Sticky Notes -- which nobody used -- but now I actually use Sticky Notes to put reminders on my Desktop"
"They're quick, easy, and work just like a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen"
"#7 JUMP LISTS There are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program"
"Jump lists include most recently used files, or you can pin your own files, too"
"These are nice time-savers"
"#8 SAVED SEARCHES In Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use"
"This is handy to find filtered data in the future"
"When you re-execute the search, it creates a dynamic results set (so your search is never stale)"
"#9 CONTENT VIEW & ARRANGING Also in Windows Explorer, two new features"
"Now you can arrange a folder into subdivisions by date (great for your pictures folders!)"
"You can use the Content view to combine thumbnails of files along with details that usually are found only in the Details view"
"#10 USER ACCOUNT CONTROL Most everyone hated UAC in Vista (even though it helped to keep your computer safe)"
"In Windows 7, Microsoft tamped down the annoyance factor of UAC"
"You can change your date and time without setting off UAC, for example"
"You can also decide whether UAC should go into secured Desktop mode whenever it does get triggered (secured Desktop is when your screen darkens and you're forced to respond to UAC's dialog box asking permission to run a program or make a change to your system)"
"You can easily turn-off UAC, too"
"#11 PAINT, WORDPAD, CALCULATOR All three of these utilities got updated"
"Wordpad and Paint have the Office-like "ribbon" now, and Calculator has a few new memory keys, touch sensitivity, and a Programmer view for those dealing with hexidecimals and binaries"
"#12 HOMEGROUP SHARING This is the easiest way to share data with others in your (home) network"
"HomeGroup creates a password that is shared among computers, and that takes care of all the issues with user accounts, file permissions and "access denied" problems"
"This is great for unsophisticated home networks"
"I made this feature last because I'm not using it -- I just think it's a great idea for inexperienced users"
"Note: all the networked computers need to be running Windows 7 to make HomeGroup sharing work"
"In short, think of Windows 7 as Windows Vista done right.I purchased this full version so I could load it on my Macbook via bootcamp and it worked flawlessly"
"All of the drivers for my computer peripherals were loaded correctly"
"The At&T Uverse wireless internet was configured in a snap"
"Bootcamp is a great utility"
