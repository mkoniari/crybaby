Output strings: [Windows 7 gets the basics right., Windows 7 Review
	We look at the strengths and weaknesses of Microsoft's promising new operating system, Windows 7., Should You Give Up XP for Windows 7?, Windows 7, set to arrive on new PCs and as a shrinkwrapped upgrade on October 22, has a minimalist feel and attempts to fix an??noyances old and new., In contrast, Windows Vista offered a flashy new interface, but its poor performance, compatibility gotchas, and lack of compelling features made some folks regret upgrading and others refuse to leave Windows XP., Windows 7 is hardly flawless., Some features feel unfinished; others won't realize their potential without heavy lifting by third parties., But overall, the final shipping version I test-drove appears to be the worthy successor to Windows XP that Vista never was., Microsoft's release of Windows 7 also roughly coincides with Apple's release of its new Snow Leopard; for a visual comparison of the two operating systems, see our slideshow "Snow Leopard Versus Windows 7." Of course, an OS can't be a winner if it turns a zippy PC into a slowpoke or causes installation nightmares., Consult "Windows 7 Performance Tests" for Windows 7 performance test results, and "How to Upgrade to Windows 7" for hands-on advice on the best way to install it., Read on here for an in-depth look at how Microsoft has changed its OS--mostly for the better--in Windows 7., Interface: The New Taskmaster
		The Windows experience occurs mainly in its Taskbar--especially in the Start menu and System Tray., Vista gave the Start menu a welcome redesign; in Windows 7, the Taskbar and the System Tray get a thorough makeover., Windows 7's revamped Taskbar introduces several new features and gives users much more control over how it looks.The new Taskbar replaces the old small icons and text labels for running apps with larger, unlabeled icons., If you can keep the icons straight, the new design painlessly reduces Taskbar clutter., If you don't like it, you can shrink the icons and/or bring the labels back., In the past, you could get one-click access to programs by dragging their icons to the Quick Launch toolbar., Windows 7 eliminates Quick Launch and folds its capabilities into the Taskbar., Drag an app's icon from the Start menu or desktop to the Taskbar, and Windows will pin it there, so you can launch the program without rummaging around in the Start menu., To indicate that a particular application on the Taskbar is running, Windows draws a subtle box around its icon--so subtle, in fact, that figuring out whether the app is running can take a moment, especially if its icon sits between two icons for running apps., In Windows Vista, hovering the mouse pointer over an application's Taskbar icon produces a thumbnail window view known as a Live Preview., But when you have multiple windows open, you see only one preview at a time., Windows 7's version of this feature is slicker and more efficient: Hover the pointer on an icon, and thumbnails of the app's windows glide into position above the Taskbar, so you can quickly find the one you're looking for., (The process would be even simpler if the thumbnails were larger and easier to decipher.)
		Also new in Windows 7's Taskbar is a feature called Jump Lists., These menus resemble the context-sensitive ones you get when you right-click within various Windows applications, except that you don't have to be inside an app to use them., Internet Explorer 8's Jump List, for example, lets you open the browser and load a fresh tab, initiate an InPrivate stealth browsing session, or go directly to any of eight frequently visited Web pages., Non-Microsoft apps can offer Jump Lists, too, if their developers follow the guidelines for creating them., Other Windows 7 interface adjustments are minor, yet so sensible that you may wonder why Windows didn't include them all along., Shove a window into the left or right edge of the screen and it'll expand to fill half of your desktop., Nudge another into the opposite edge of the screen, and it'll expand to occupy the other half., If you nudge a window into the top of the screen, it will maximize to occupy all of the display's real estate., The extreme right edge of the Taskbar now sports a sort of nub; hover over it, and open windows become transparent, revealing the desktop below., (Microsoft calls this feature Aero Peek.) Click the nub, and the windows scoot out of the way, giving you access to documents or apps that reside on the desktop and duplicating the Show Desktop feature that Quick Launch used to offer., Getting at your desktop may soon be??come even more important than it was in the past., That's because Windows 7 does away with the Sidebar, the portion of screen space that Windows Vista reserved for Gadgets such as a photo viewer and a weather applet., Instead of occupying the Sidebar, Gadgets now sit directly on the desktop, where they don't compete with other apps for precious screen real estate., Old Tray, New Tricks: Windows 7's Taskbar and window management tweaks are nice., But its changes to the System Tray--aka the Notification Area--have a huge positive effect., Changes in Windows 7 transform the System Tray from an intrusive eyesore (in Windows Vista) into a useful set of shortcuts and other controls.In the past, no feature of Windows packed more frustration per square inch than the System Tray., It quickly grew dense with applets that users did not want in the first place, and many of the uninvited guests employed word balloons and other intrusive methods to alert users to uninteresting facts at inopportune moments., At their worst, System Tray applets behaved like belligerent squatters, and Windows did little to put users back in charge., In Windows 7, applets can't pester you unbidden because software installers can't dump them into the System Tray., Instead, applets land in a holding pen that appears only when you click it, a much-improved version of the overflow area used in previous incarnations of the Tray., App?lets in the pen can't float word balloons at you unless you permit them to do so., It's a cinch to drag them into the System Tray or out of it again, so you enjoy complete control over which applets reside there., More good news: Windows 7 largely dispenses with the onslaught of word-balloon warnings from the OS about troubleshooting issues, potential security problems, and the like., A new area called Action Center--a revamped version of Vista's Security Center--queues up such alerts so you can deal with them at your convenience., Action Center does issue notifications of its own from the System Tray, but you can shut these off if you don't want them pestering you., All of this helps make Windows 7 the least distracting, least intrusive Microsoft OS in a very long time., It's a giant step forward from the days when Windows thought nothing of interrupting your work to inform you that it had de??tected unused icons on your desktop., Posting comment ..., A new Xerox ColorQube? can increase print quality and reduce costs., Start saving today., Make your dreams come true with $25k or your choice of hundreds of prizes., Breathtaking 3D Laptop, The holidays are upon us, and we all know what that means: More time for gaming!, And so games will be my main focus for the next week., A particle system is a computer graphics model for convincingly simulating fluid or fuzzy objects such as flame, smoke, water bubbles, and the like., You are a sort of modern-day Rip Van Winkle., You?ve been in a state of suspended animation for forty-two years., Buy Kaspersky Anti-Virus and Internet Security 2011 today to begin defending yourself against known and emerging viruses and spyware., Windows 7 Performance Tests, Windows 7 Freebies: Where to Get Giveaways, Speed Test: Windows 7 May Not Be Much Faster Than Vista, See All Prices, See All Prices, See All Prices, See All Prices, See all Office Suites, An ERP system is your information backbone and reaches into all areas of your business and value chain., This white paper explains the 12 criteria that allow you to identify and select the solution that will meet these expectations., This white paper details how Web 2.0 technologies support business strategies by improving efficiency, productivity, and collaboration., Get great stories from PCWorld like this one delivered in your inbox for free!, Reinstall Windows Without Losing Your Data, You can enable them by clicking "on" above., MSM Posted Aug 12th 2009 2:09PMHighest RankedLove to see how it turns out,, even as a Mac fan, I honestly hope for Microsoft to do some good for once :), MSM Posted Aug 12th 2009 2:13PMLowest Rankdon't get me wrong though, I still believe that a Mac is way better than a PC, heimbachae Posted Aug 12th 2009 2:17PMLowest Rankand it is, which is why we'll get downvoted together my friend!!, (Unverified) Posted Aug 12th 2009 2:23PMLowest RankOh yeah, well my dad can beat up your dad!, (Unverified) Posted Aug 12th 2009 2:42PMLowest RankSo, if I make changes to my PC (adding RAM, bigger HD, new graphics card, new router, etc), will Windows 7 stop working until I call India and beg and plead with them that, no, I didn't steal it and could they please, oh pretty please, revalidate it for me?, And yes, the minor updates I listed above caused Vista to freak out.What Microsoft didn't understand then is that they think they are preventing me from buying Windows once and then never buying again by using my one copy and then continually changing PCs., On my side of the table, however, what I see is that Microsoft is preventing me from accessing my data., If Apple does the same thing, I'll switch to Linux in a heartbeat., MarkAnderson Posted Aug 12th 2009 2:44PMHighest Ranked@YoshiNo-one believes you, son., ANDZT Posted Aug 12th 2009 2:50PMNeutralMac's are easier to hack, non-upgradeable, and more expensive for the same specs...., MatthewJ Posted Aug 12th 2009 2:50PMHighest Ranked@yoshiyou must be pretty bad at the whole computing thing, I've upgraded every single one of those pieces of hardware, as well as my CPU, with Vista (more than once where a hard drive is concerned) and I've never had to contact Microsoft to revalidate my license., NetDude Posted Aug 12th 2009 2:59PMHighest RankedThat's just it, there is no way a new router would ever cause the system key to become invalid., NohOne Posted Aug 12th 2009 3:06PMHighest Ranked@yoshiWindows XP: Every time I upgrade RAM, CPU, or HDD, I need to call the evil M$ to reactivate., When will they stop keeping my data hostage?Windows Vista: DRM is so intertwined into the OS, that I will not be able to play any media that does not have DRM attached to it., When will they stop keeping my data hostage?Windows 7: Every time I upgrade RAM, CPU, or HDD, I need to call the evil M$ to reactivate., Tsing Tao Posted Aug 12th 2009 3:13PMHighest RankedTo be fair Yoshi may do a full install when he upgrades his hardware, why you would do that for RAM or a video card i dont know but if he did he would have to call MS and get a revalidation., One Love Posted Aug 12th 2009 3:20PMHighest RankedLast night IE kept crashing on engadget.com (not sure why) I simply pressed the "compatibility view" icon and the problems went away., o29 Posted Aug 12th 2009 3:23PMHighest RankedI've only had to call Microsoft once to revalidate my license (this was after several hardware changes, including an entirely new motherboard)., doug Posted Aug 12th 2009 3:36PMHighest Ranked@yoshinot to beat a dead horse here...but my vista runs almost flawlessly., the only time i have trouble is when i do something my computer isnt really set up to handle., im tri-booting my computer with vista, 7 rc build 7100 and ubuntu and every now and then i do something stupid and make some modifications and end up needing to reinstall an OS or format a hdd., and no matter how many times ive wiped a drive clean or reinstalled vista/7 i have never had ANY problems with my key., kudos to MS on this one.and to support FraggleRock's "macs are easier to hack" comment., all you need to know is some unix/linux coding and you can easliy boot OS X on your pc with no problem., borland502 Posted Aug 12th 2009 3:43PMHighest Ranked@YoshiI had to validate the license again over the phone once a few years ago., Of course, that license for XP Pro lasted me from release through God knows how many computers and reinstalls., Of course, the Genuine Advantage? check does seem a bit arbitrary., I once changed an entire motherboard on it without complaints, but it wanted me to revalidate after I hooked up a friend's hard drive for data recovery.Only had to call in once though., bioadam Posted Aug 12th 2009 5:07PMNeutralWindows 7 may be the cat's pajamas but I have a strong suspicion that my work computer will continue to run Windows XP for a very, very long time., I might be able to talk the management committee into buying a $200 upgrade (per XP machine) when the recession ends, but there is no way I'm going to let the IT guy run a clean install!, (Unverified) Posted Aug 12th 2009 5:53PMHighest RankedPost SP2, Vista isn't really as bloated as it used to be.7 is much better though.yoshi: You might need to revalidate only if you change your motherboard., (Unverified) Posted Aug 12th 2009 5:57PMHighest RankedBtw Paul, you can hold Shift and drag and drop a file on a program on the taskbar to open it.I like the old way too though., NetDude Posted Aug 12th 2009 6:09PMHighest RankedYour business which is so mission critical to you that you cannot have it down for a few minutes to reactivate your O/S is running on this same PC which you seem to constantly be taking offline to add/remove/change hardware seemingly on a whim?, FlyersPh9 Posted Aug 12th 2009 6:16PMNeutral@ FraggleRockMacs aren't easier to hack, they are upgradable (I upgraded my RAM to 4GB this year in my MBP), and even though they are more expense, it's because you are getting quality, no crap programs to boot, and a sweet OS.....so how do you justify that Mac ISN'T better than PC?!, sciencetroll Posted Aug 12th 2009 6:42PMHighest Rankeddont get me wrong but are we forgetting about linux?, MRCUR Posted Aug 12th 2009 6:46PMNeutralUh, Yoshi, a router is not going to cause Vista to drop it's current activation status and require a new go at it., If your box did that (I'm not saying it didn't, anything is possible I suppose), then something else was up - it certainly wasn't the normal way of Vista requiring reactivation after hardware changes (which I've never seen myself)., Jordan Posted Aug 12th 2009 9:08PMHighest RankedDon't even try, Yoshi., Stop spreading your pure crap all over the world., Jordan Posted Aug 12th 2009 9:13PMNeutral@Jon Graft:  So you upgraded your RAM, eh?, WHOOOPIEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!Now let's see you upgrade the video card, or add a PCI card from the vast library of PCI cards in the world., froggy Posted Aug 12th 2009 9:37PMHighest Ranked@yoshi: You're probably right., (Unverified) Posted Aug 13th 2009 12:38AMHighest RankedYup, I'm a Mac fan, too., This version of Windows 7 really does look good and appears to have some nice features., Many of them beyond some of the Windows users I know., I'm anxious to try either Home Premium or Pro in BootCamp when I check out what features each offer or what I need., I hope that it's not a resource hog and that an install stays relatively stable for a year., I think the reason why it doesn't come with a mail program is so consumers can run out and buy Microsoft Office with Microsoft Outlook., Haha.MS just has to convince businesses they need this Windows 7 and maybe MS will be back in the business of selling OSes again after the long, almost nine year wait., (Unverified) Posted Aug 13th 2009 4:20AMHighest Ranked@yoshiYup, I've been there with a couple of calls to Microsoft's Indian call centre, once with a reinstall of XP Pro and once when the Windows Genuine Advantage check that was performed prior to installing IE7 decided that my copy of XP Pro wasn't genuine and busted me down to un-Activated status.As I have said MANY times before, Windows Activation and Windows Genuine Advantage is a farce that needs to be abandoned., I sincerely wish that Microsoft would go back to the good ol' days when all you needed to do was type in your serial number - that was fine and did what was needed., Tes Posted Aug 13th 2009 8:43AMHighest Ranked@iphonerulezYeah, Microsoft REALLY should get back to that whole OS thing that they've been dominating in for almost two decades...Do some of you people live on the same planet as the rest of us or not?, (Unverified) Posted Aug 13th 2009 9:18PMHighest RankedWhile I'm not saying yoshi isn't lying, I will point out that I've had many issues similar to what he describes...I work at a computer store and I can't count how many times I've had customers come in with valid windows keys failing genuine advantage..., Quite often it happens without changing any hardware whatsoever, other times it's been things like upgrading a video card or ram, usually a single piece of hardware., Often times it will fail online and I have to call India, and while usually they're pretty good about it, I've had times where they've told me to talk to the OEM to get it straightened out..., As I'm sure you're all aware, calling dell or HP isn't going to get you anywhere, and in cases where it's been OUR system we built in shop, I've screamed at poor indian people that I AM THE F**KING OEM!!, They inconvenience hundreds of thousands of legitimate users, while pirates never have to deal with this crap., ThreeDee912 Posted Aug 14th 2009

Deserved or not, Microsoft had dug itself a cool, deep, dark hole with Windows Vista., Users demanding that Redmond extend the life of Windows XP wasn't exactly something they could be proud of, either., Bombarded by complaints and negative press even after the first service pack was released, the bar had been set high for Vista's successor: Windows 7., This review is based on an official copy of the Windows 7 RTM that Microsoft provided to CNET on July 30, 2009., Luckily for Microsoft, Windows 7 is more than just spin., Importantly, it won't require the hardware upgrades that Vista demanded, partially because the hardware has caught up, and partially because Microsoft has gone to great lengths to make Windows 7 accessible to as many people as possible., It's important to note that the public testing process for Windows 7 involved one limited-availability beta and one release candidate, and constituted what some have called the largest shareware trial period ever., As buggy and irritating as Vista was, Windows 7 isn't., Instead, it's the successor to Windows XP that Microsoft wishes Vista had been, and finally places it on competitive footing with other major operating systems like OS X and Linux., Microsoft is offering six versions of Windows 7: Starter, Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate, OEM, and Enterprise., The three versions that Redmond will be promoting most heavily are Home Premium, Professional, and Ultimate, although Starter will also be available to consumers., Windows 7 will support both 32-bit and 64-bit systems., The bare minimum requirements for the 32-bit include a 1GHz processor, 1GB RAM, 16GB available hard-disk space, and a DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver., 64-bit systems will require at least a 1 GHz processor, 2GB RAM, 20GB of free space on your hard drive, and a DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver., Do note that some users have claimed to have limited success running the Windows 7 beta with less than 1GB of RAM, but that's not recommended., Installation

Microsoft is offering several paths to install Windows 7., People can buy a new computer with the operating system already installed, upgrade from Windows XP or Vista, or do a clean install on a computer the user already owns., The clean installation took us about 30 minutes, but that will vary depending on your computer., The upgrade procedure is different depending on whether you're running Windows XP or Windows Vista., Vista users merely need to back up their data before choosing the Upgrade option from the install disc., Both XP Home and XP Pro users will have to back up their data, then choose Custom from the install disc., Custom will have the same effect as a clean install, although it'll save your old data in a folder called Windows.old., Once you choose Custom, you'll need to select the partition of your hard drive that contains Windows XP, and then follow the instructions to enter your product key and allow the computer to reboot as needed., If you're not sure if your current computer can run Windows 7, you can download and run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor from Microsoft., Features: Taskbar and Aero Peek Although the look of Windows 7 may seem to be nothing more than some polish applied liberally to the Vista Aero theme, make no mistake: This is a full replacement operating system, and more than just "Vista done right." From driver support to multitouch groundwork for the future, from better battery management to the most easy-to-use interface Microsoft has ever had, Windows 7 is hardly half-baked., This is one of the best improvements Microsoft has made--third-party program dock makers are going to have to do some serious innovation when Windows 7 goes public., It features pinned programs using large, easy-to-see icons., Mouse over one and all windows associated with that program appear in preview., Mouse over one of those preview panes to reveal an X to close the window., Hover over the preview to show a full-size preview of the program, or click on the window to bring it to the front., Jump lists are another new taskbar improvement that make recently opened documents easier to get to., Right-click or left-click and drag on any program icon pinned to the taskbar to see a list of files that you've recently used in that program., In Internet Explorer, this will show recently visited Web sites, although it doesn't yet seem to work in Firefox., Mouse over to the right corner., Click on the box to minimize all your programs., Aero Peek shows the desktop when you hover over the right edge of the toolbar, and is also an option in the program-switching hot key Alt+Tab., (This image was taken from the Windows 7 Release Candidate, but looks and functions the same in the official version of Windows 7./Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)
  Resizing programs has been simplified and improved by the capability to drag a window's title bar., Drag a program window to the top of your monitor to expand it to full screen., Dragging a program away from the top or sides will return it to its original size., This is an entirely new feature in Windows 7, but it should prove easy to adopt because it mimics and expands on the maximize/restore button that people have been resizing windows with since Windows 95., Theme packages also make it much faster to change the look of Windows 7., Click on one to download it, and it instantly changes the color scheme and background--no need to reboot., Windows Media Player and Device Stage One of the biggest new features makes Windows Media Player useful again: you can now stream media files from one Windows 7 computer to another, across the Internet and out of network., When you open Windows Media Player, there's a new Stream option on the toolbar., When you've associated a second Windows 7's WMP with that same ID, you can remotely access the media on the host computer., Microsoft reinvigorates the Windows Media Player by allowing users to stream their media files to themselves., All it takes is two Windows 7 computers, an Internet connection, and a free Windows Live ID., (This image was taken from the Windows 7 Release Candidate, but looks and functions the same in the official version of Windows 7./Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)
 Hide Review Next page  
The new Device Stage makes managing peripherals significantly easier, combining printers, phones, and portable media players into one window., A large photo of the peripheral summarizes important device stats and makes it easy to identify which devices you're using., Device Stage can also be used to preset common tasks, such as synchronization., Device Stage support for older devices makes one of Windows 7's best features applicable to peripherals and externals that don't need to be upgraded., One annoying change is that Bluetooth driver support no longer comes baked into the operating system., Search, touch screens, and XP mode Windows 7's native search feature has been improved., Files added to the hard drive were indexed so fast that they were searchable less than 5 seconds later., Search result snippets now include a longer snippet, and highlight the snippet more clearly., This should appeal specifically to people who juggle large numbers of long documents, but it's a useful feature for anybody who wants to find files faster., However, the search field is available by default only in the Start menu and in Windows Explorer, and cannot be easily added to the taskbar., Search snippets do a better job of highlighting relevant terms in your documents, exposing useful data even if it's not in the file name., (This image was taken from the Windows 7 Release Candidate, but looks and functions the same in the official version of Windows 7./Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)
  Touch-screen features worked surprisingly well., The hardware sometimes misread some of the multitouch gestures, occasionally confusing rotating an image, for example, with zooming in or out of the image., Overall, though, there were few difficulties in performing the basic series of gestures that Microsoft promotes, and this places Windows 7 in an excellent position for the future, as more and more computers are released with multitouch abilities., Experts and people or companies who hope to use Windows 7 for business situations will appreciate the new XP Mode., It doesn't have much of a practical application for the home consumer, but if you need to access programs designed for Windows XP that have not been upgraded to Windows Vista or 7, XP Mode creates a virtual environment within Windows 7 that should assuage any fears of upgrading without backward compatibility., Windows 7 supports a feature that won't be useful to most users, but businesses might do a double-take., XP Mode is a free add-on for Windows 7 that creates a virtual XP environment in which you can run older programs., (This image was taken from the Windows 7 Release Candidate, but looks and functions the same in the official version of Windows 7./Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)
  It's not easy to set up once you've downloaded the XP Mode installer., You'll need to double-check that you have the right hardware, and can get the right software., Motherboards older than two years probably won't work, and even if you do have a newer one you might have to go into your BIOS and activate Hardware Virtualization., Users will have full access to peripherals connected to their Windows 7 hardware, including printers, and the clipboard can be used to cut and paste between the virtual operating system and the "real" one., Security
User Account Control, or UAC, is back in Windows 7., UAC was one of the biggest changes in Vista., Windows 7 provides more options for user customization of UAC., The default setting is to notify users only when programs try to make changes to the computer, one step below the most restrictive setting of Always Notify., Under Always Notify, anytime a program tries to access the Internet, or you try to make changes to the computer, Windows 7 will require user confirmation., The second-least restrictive option doesn't dim the desktop when UAC is activated, and will only notify the user when programs try to make changes to the computer., When the desktop dims, Windows 7 is locking it down and preventing access., Never Notify is the most relaxed option, and is only recommended by Microsoft for programs that aren't compatible with UAC., UAC also displays a blue banner when confronted with a program from a known publisher versus a yellow banner and exclamation point when the program is from an unknown publisher., The number of clicks it should take to use UAC safely has been reduced, However, it's important to note that it's a less aggressive default posture by UAC., Unlike Windows XP and Windows Vista, Windows 7 will no longer AutoRun external hard drives and USB keys when they're connected., This kills off a risky vector for malware infections that has been the bane of many security experts., Although Microsoft is working on a revamp of its antivirus and antimalware program, now called Microsoft Security Essentials, it won't be bundled with Windows 7., Users are still required to download a third-party antivirus and antimalware program, although the Windows Firewall remains intact., As with many features in Windows 7 that have been carried over from Windows Vista, people will notice there's far more granular settings control than before., Features like filtering outbound traffic, which were available in Vista but not exposed, are easier to access in Windows 7., Minimum hardware

4,217?, As you can see in the chart, we found that Windows 7 RTM was the fastest to shutdown, and was tied with XP for iTunes encoding., However, it was slower than XP and Vista for both booting up cold by a bit more than 1 second, and slower than either of its predecessors in its Microsoft Office performance., After having used Windows 7 beta, RC, and now the RTM for more than six months combined, it still feels faster for us when launching programs, opening the control panel, and dragging icons, files, and folders around than XP., That's not to denigrate the value of the benchmarks, but keep in mind that the perception and reality might differ based on hardware and usage., Support
When you try to use a file already in use, Windows 7 goes beyond Vista and XP by telling you not just that it's being used, but where it's being used so you can manage the situation faster., Other than that, Windows 7 offers on-board operating system support nearly identical to Windows Vista., Screen darkening, one-click action hand-holding, and a useful question mark icon on all Explorer windows maintain Vista's improved help features, when compared with Windows XP., In sum Windows 7 looks like the operating system that both Microsoft and its consumers have been waiting for., By fixing most of the perceived and real problems in Vista, Microsoft has laid the groundwork for the future of where Windows will go., Windows 7 presents a stable platform that can compete comfortably with OS X, while reassuring the world that Microsoft can still turn out a strong, useful operating system., In order to view comments on gizmodo.com you need to enable JavaScript., If you are using Firefox and NoScript addon, please mark gizmodo.com as trusted., Attribute comment to:, Please enter an email address., Please enter a valid email address., Loading comments ..., Other discussions  | Show all discussions | Show featured discussions only | 358, Windows 7 ReviewBy: Nick Mokey ??January 1, 2010ShareTweetWe put Windows 7 through the paces in our detailed review., Nearly three years after Microsoft unleashed Windows Vista unto the world, crippling otherwise competent computers with obscene system requirements and feature bloat, Microsoft has returned for redemption with Windows 7, otherwise known as ?what Vista should have been.? Though not as revolutionary in appearance as its predecessor, Microsoft has promised a slew of long-awaited refinements, including better performance, a powerful universal search, and better driver and hardware compatibility., We popped our freshly minted RTM copy of Windows 7 into the favorite office testbed ? HP?s Firebird ? and put the new OS through its paces to see whether Redmond can deliver on its promises when Windows 7 hits the streets on October 22.Check out our Window 7 video review.InstallationNot surprisingly, the installer for Windows 7 looks uncannily like Windows Vista?s: pop in the disc, navigate through a few questions about where you want it installed, then let it grind out the rest., Amazingly, it took only 17 minutes after finishing up the brief question period to landing on the Windows 7 desktop ? a pretty impressive feat.After launching for the very first time, Windows 7 transparently dealt with all our Firebird?s hardware except the video card, which we had to right click on under device manager and ask it to pull new drivers for., After a short automated search and install process, we had month-old drivers on the machine without so much as having to open a browser ? though we did find slightly fresher drivers on Nvidia?s site.The New DesktopWhile Windows 7 retains the same glassy window style, icons and many other holdovers from Vista, more users will immediately notice that the taskbar has changed dramatically., A slightly taller taskbar now accommodates large, squared-off icons (rather than rectangular labels) in the bar, making it in some ways similar to Mac?s OS X dock., If you do decide to revert to the old ways, Windows 7 will allow you to turn off the icon-based system, and also shrink the taskbar back to its original size.New and improved Windows 7 taskbarSince icons alone don?t tell you what?s going on with your desktop at any given time, Microsoft has implemented its new Aero Peek feature to fill in the necessary details., Hovering over any icon (or clicking if you?re in a hurry) will show the separate thumbnails for each window within any given program, like different Firefox windows, along with labels (Yahoo, Digg, Downloads, etc.) above them., You can also right-click on any of the taskbar icons to get Jump Lists, which are basically shortcut lists pertaining to the programs., For instance, IE will present shortcuts for your last visited sites and tasks, like opening a new tab, while Windows Media player will let you pause or skip forward through playlists without actually opening it to full screen.Hover over any icon to view thumbnailsWith many users now sporting enormous widescreen monitors, Windows 7?s new ?snaps? feature turned out to be one of the most unexpectedly smart additions to make the most of all that real estate., Grab any window, drag it to the right or left edge of the screen, and it will automatically resize to half the screen., This makes it easy to browse on two screens at once to compare, type in Word with a browser window next to it, and so on., Additional options for snapping (akin to those the freeware AllSnap offers) would still be appreciated, though.Windows 7 new snap featureFor those who immediately look at a Windows desktop and want to get to work making it their own, Microsoft has made that easier, as well., The new personalization menu features a wide array of attractive built-in themes, plus the means to switch them up by swapping backgrounds, screensavers, and even picking a custom color from a mixer for menus and using a slider to determine its opacity., This isn?t quite a WindowBlinds level of customization, but it?s easy, and 99 percent of users will probably be thrilled with the results.Windows 7 personalization optionsA revamped device management window takes much of the confusion out of connecting new gadgets., Simple devices like hard drives, thumb drives and webcams will mostly be automatically detected, and show up under this pane alongside other connected items like mice, keyboards and Wi-Fi adapters., Although we didn?t witness it in our demo, manufacturers will also be able to customize the windows with specific images and custom interfaces.Windows 7 device management 12Next ?Related PostsAnalyst warns Microsoft needs tablet to?Microsoft locks down SD cards on Windows?Microsoft announces fat profits, free ph?Microsoft to release Windows 8 in 2012?, Latest PostsApache Software Foundation launches ?Apache Extras?Gmail creator has no faith in Chrome OSWhat we know about Google?s Cr-48 Chrome OS notebook so farApache quits Java group, picks up WaveE-reader sales to jump 68 percent in 2011, says Gartner, 308 comments Add a Comment (Log in or register)  Showing 1 of 7 pages (308 Comments)  prev 1 2 3 4 ..., One thing I wonder though -

it had less to do with work/home systems and more to do with price, and here's why: A huge number of people were perfectly happy with buying a cheaper computer (maybe pre-installed with DOS), and installing a copied disk (or rather, set of floppies) of DOS and Windows in order to get a GUI-based computer., There was also little to justify that additional cost Today is a far different story due to the rise of malware, OS efficiency factors, and hardware longevity..., @sanenazok: Google News is your friend -

Apples to onions- I like that- that was clever., :)

The support scope is completely different between Linux and Windows cultures., Whom can I contact for direct on site Linux support with a financial guarantee against a set downtime allowance?, When a company has equipment go down, that scope of service comes into play and if there are violations, that service company has to make up the difference in fines and paybacks., I can name off IBM, HP, Dell, and Siemens right off the top of my head that offer this to enterprise level customers., I'm not aware of any Linux providers that can offer that level of support- or the financial guarantee to back it up., There may be indeed companies out there that do this for Linux, but they aren't making themselves known too well., They simply don't have the support model in place., The only way they could possibly offer it to enterprise is to let go of their deathgrip on their OS and hardware to allow third parties to offer solutions., by Penguinisto January 7, 2009 1:01 PM PST  "Whom can I contact for direct on site Linux support with a financial guarantee against a set downtime allowance?"Dell, HP, IBM - they all provide that for Linux, right now; same as they do for any other OS

money to be made from it., Relatively speaking I get a lot more "fixit" type request from Windows users than Mac users., From Mac users, especially switchers, it's usually "how do i"., After the Mac users learn their way around the system, I almost never here from them., by tm_anon January 10, 2009 9:18 PM PST  @Vegaman_DanSpeaking as a fairly new Linux user, there's a reason more people support Windows than either Linux or Macintosh., When I was running XP, even as stable as that OS may be, I still had downtime., I still had to run antivirus scans, I still needed to defrag the system, I had to call MSFT support for help removing a nasty virus infestation., I went to Linux and it's there when I want it, that's it., I run an antivirus scan once a day to protect my friends who use Windows, but otherwise there would be no need for even that at the moment., In other words, like the Mac, when a person switches to Linux, the only thing most need to know is how to use it., Other than that, you just have fun with it., Dee January 7, 2009 7:01 AM PST  I am going to post a better review today, just watch., by D3vildog699 January 10, 2009 11:14 AM PST  Can you link it?, by sting7k January 7, 2009 7:08 AM PST  Well this is interesting, they say it was running pretty well on just a P4 and only 512MB of RAM., Maybe Windows 7 can bring my old Dell laptop back to live with it's 2.4Ghz P4 and 2GB of RAM, it really struggles now with only XP., I'm looking forward to this, Vista already runs fine for me on my newer Dell laptop with a Core 2 Duo so Win7 should do nicely., by BigGuns149 January 7, 2009 10:49 AM PST  You are a bit vague as to what degree that your old P4 struggles with XP, but for most applications your laptop should run XP fine(ie., it probably shouldn't need an upgrade in software or hardware)., For only a couple hundred dollars more than what an OEM version of Windows 7 is likely to cost you could buy a laptop that uses a faster dual core processor, faster RAM, and probably even a larger HDD., I hate to break it to you, but P4s are really *old* and contrary to what the clock speed may imply they tend to run *slower* sometimes dramatically compared to many of the dual core processors on the market., The last "new" mobile P4 was released almost five years ago, which means that your laptop at *best* case scenario is still probably over three years old., In the current economy I can completely understand people being reluctant to upgrade their computers on a whim, but it is only a matter of time before the hardware on your old laptop fails in which case you might as well get a new laptop because any repair is likely to be almost as expensive of a cheap new laptop., Considering all the benefits I think you would be much happier with a new computer than putting Windows 7 on your old laptop that is probably on its' last legs., by celticbrewer January 7, 2009 12:29 PM PST  Wow., My (free) laptop sucks bigtime compared to yours but it can run XP fairly well though logon to desktop is a bit long., You should probably make sure there's no applications running that you don't want (malware or resource hogs)., They'll suck the life right out of your PC (most likely on purpose)., by ithomas94 January 8, 2009 5:24 PM PST  You know, you COULD try installing one of the various distro's of LInux on there.Linux will be able to save your

partition., Windows 7 by default uses GPT as opposed to MBR as the system for bootloaders, but the standard by default creates a 200MB protective partition so that older MBR only systems don't think the HDD is unformatted., MacOS creates these 200MB protective partitions as well for legacy support for dual booting MBR based OS (ie., by random truth-22471513702271725 January 8, 2009 7:49 PM PST  Wow, Thats great they are finally moving away from the crap that is mbr..., Linux and macintosh have supported gpt for a while., Maybee I will be able to boot windows from a usb hard drive soon., by knerdy January 10, 2009 8:06 PM PST  Correct., It's for BitLocker, Boot-From-VHD support and other low-level volume and disk technologies., Essentially the BIOS loads the small partition (which is Active) where it finds Bootmgr/BCD/etc., Then the Bootmgr loads up the overall OS from your bigger partition., This way the first phase of the boot is simple and clean and does not have to worry about advanced functionality like Bitlocker, VHD, etc., by ryokowerx January 7, 2009 7:29 AM PST  I'm cautiously optomistic on this., This is assuming that MS doesn't at the last minute load the OS down with bloatware or other "last minute" cool ideas (that should have stayed in the lab)., by BigGuns149 January 7, 2009 11:10 AM PST  I followed the development of Vista and the problem wasn't that they loaded the thing with bloatware., So they would spend months working on WinFS and then they would announce that they weren't going to include that., Since they are reusing the same kernel most hardware drivers from Vista can be reused without issue., Hence, the whole snafu of the OS launching with so-so hardware support will be completely sidestepped., At this point there are still a lot of rough edges, but so far Windows 7 looks pretty good., by ducttape36 January 7, 2009 7:33 AM PST  im excited., by BigGuns149 January 7, 2009 11:13 AM PST  Windows 7 is nice, but people like you who

better in security than XP and OSX.-------------------------------------------------------------------LOL., by BigGuns149 January 7, 2009 11:23 AM PST  Actually the analogy is *very* poor., Windows Me was largely an attempt to squeeze one last release out of the Windows 9X code., Windows Vista is NOT XP with a few minor changes.Windows 7 though is starting to sound a lot like Windows XP (ie., Unlike XP, Windows 7 does appear to run faster than Vista on some hardware configurations, but the minor UI changes aside very little has changed under the hood., It will still be a big upgrade compared to XP, but for existing Vista users I don't see many compelling reasons to upgrade to Windows 7., right now I probably wouldn't advise anyone with Vista to waste their money on such a minor update)., by Inconnux January 8, 2009 10:33 PM PST  not at all like WinME...., I do the IT for my work and I have put a ban on all Vista machines, if anyone wants one, they have to do their own tech support., Win7 'looks' promising as it seems to out perform xp and blows Vista performance out of the water., by ssampier January 12, 2009 8:49 PM PST  Windows Vista is more like Windows 95., It's not a perfect analogy since before Windows 95 we have Win 3.11; at least Win 95 had some new stuff., by mooney101 January 7, 2009 7:45 AM PST  Apple will never catch up with windows until the start

company, M$ is a software company., Apple happens to develop their own OS for their hardware, which people like better than M$'s offerings because it's far less insulting overall., But allowing third party vendors to offer OS X doesn't make much sense when Apple is trying to sell more computers, does it., by celticbrewer January 7, 2009 12:39 PM PST  @Perry: "Macs are not overpriced for what you

Its a supremely egocentric view of reality that just boggles my mind., by CrashPad63 January 7, 2009 8:26 AM PST  Hell son you dont even work at on office., by zxys January 7, 2009 8:36 AM PST  Totally agree.Although I've been using "7" to a degree,...and,..., by Dalkorian January 7, 2009 10:02 AM PST  by CrashPad63 January 7, 2009 8:26 AM PSTEvery objection about Vista you speak of is 10 fold on the Mac experience.------------------------------------------------------------------Bull., It's painfully obvious that you have never used a Mac before at all and equally obvious that you have only the faintest idea what a computer actually does under the covers., Now go tell your masters you have done their bidding and hope they pay you for it., by compudoc318 January 7, 2009 3:10 PM PST  wow youre college educated kids cant use vista, but my 80 year old customers been using it since day one with no issues......., by MDiddy6579 January 8, 2009 1:36 PM PST  sjalsevacIt seems to be that you are the type of person that spreads this falsity that Vista is a horrible OS., First and foremost, your "Wow" comment shows just what type of office you run., "Wow" should not be considered for a production environment.Also, your "bad" experience with should not be blamed on MS, but the OEM's you purchased the machines from., MS is only partially to blame for allowing the OEM's to install their unnecessary junk software they do that causes machine to be sluggish, unresponsive., A clean installation of Vista loaded with only the programs one needs makes for a speedy machine.We've configured and installed hundreds of Vista machines that have had almost no issues, short of a few porrly written drivers., by ithomas94 January 8, 2009 5:32 PM PST  Well, I'm sorry, but if Windows 7 does not "wow" while the Mac OS most certainly does, Windows 7 wil not be used by me or in my office (25 workstations) anymore., "wow" is essential.Wow?If you want wow, switch to Ubuntu.Or Linux in general.And guess what?, You won't have to pay over $1500 for it.Its FREE., by Wispa65 January 10, 2009 12:09 PM PST  First of all i mean absolutely no disrespect to your opinions., With that said, why is it that when people like you (those who had a bad MS experience) hear someone speak positively about a MS OS (Vista) you go on to throw a tangent accusing others of being a Microsoft fanboy or doing "PR" for Microsoft?, And you do have the right to contribute to the topic by stating your quams., And if "we" feel the need to contribute to the topic in a "pro" MS then i believe that we should be shot down like that., I get what i want from my current OS (Vista Ultimate), and it works flawless., You're switching to a Mac, well kudos to you!, by frankwick January 7, 2009 7:59 AM PST  I have to admit as a relative newcomer to Vista, IT IS NOT THE EVIL SOFTWARE I thought it would be., Yes, my laptop is loaded with 2.5 GB of RAM, but the OS is a pleasure to use., To be fair, I don't have any off-the-wall hardware and I did a fresh install from the disk., If Win7 improves on Vista, then it should be a great OS., Contrary to what the apple commercials say, I think MS is doing a VERY GOOD job with their flagship OS., by MSSlayer January 7, 2009 2:57 PM PST  Put XP on it and it will be considerably more responsive., Put Linux on it and it will be considerably faster.In other words, put a real OS on it and see how crappy Vista is., by compudoc318 January 7, 2009 3:11 PM PST  yeah, like an every day user could go right to linux with no issues......lol., by karpenterskids January 7, 2009 4:24 PM PST  Same here...I'm currently using both a Macbook and a computer with Windows Vista, but if Windows 7 delivers on its promises, my next computer is going to be a PC.I'm poor.I can't afford to be continually buying something as expensive as a Mac., by tm_anon January 7, 2009 5:19 PM PST  @compudoc318I'm an everyday user, I went to Ubuntu with no issues., Actually, I went to Ubuntu after burning the OS to a CD and installed it directly from XP with no issues since everything ran like any other program would on XP., It even handled partitioning of the hard drive for me as well as updating and installing any and all drivers I needed for my comp., Not sure what's so hard about that, but apparently I can't do anything I've done so I might as well go back to XP., by kr3bstar January 10, 2009 11:56 AM PST  To expand on MSSlayer's comments, put DOS 3.11, Coherent, or Xenix on it and it will be even faster still., by Sabroson January 10, 2009 6:31 PM PST  It is all relative my friend., Have you ever used a Mac?Most of us were pretty happy with VHS until DVDs came along ..., by The_happy_switcher January 7, 2009 8:01 AM PST  And it's only taken 8 years to make an OS that's faster than XP., by Dalkorian January 7, 2009 10:04 AM PST  I hear your sarcasm, but I'd refrain from even that until fista sp3 has been released (oh that's right, they want to call it winblows 7)., by compudoc318 January 7, 2009 3:12 PM PST  yeah and its only taken apple like 20 years just to get close to a 10% share......lol  Like this, by tm_anon January 7, 2009 5:28 PM PST  @compudoc318Do you really think market share has anything to do with having a quality OS?, Mention her name in most countries around the world I'm betting they've heard of her, mention yours and they'll look at me funny., by Xemiphor January 10, 2009 4:18 PM PST  Apple produces makeup mirrors with LCD screens., That's their mission statement, and their mission will reach critical mass, like, never.It's kind of like the quote from "Raising Arizona" "If you want to hail a cop, you'll find him at a donut shop." If you want to find a Mac, the nut didn't far very fall from the apple tree., by Solitary_Geek January 7, 2009 8:03 AM PST  Wow..., the BS is so deep I need boots to wade through it., Windows Vista is anything but "a worthy upgrade from XP"., What do you do online, and with your computer, play Solitaire and IM your friends on AOL?Even when Vista is cut down, themes and unneeded services disabled, and after numerous performance tweaks, Vista is still fairly unstable, slow and "buggy"...., How can anyone believe that MS will somehow make everything right with Windows 7?, Windows 7 is "The" operating system Windows Vista victims paid for already., That's what MS promised in all their BS commercials and advertisements., Now a couple of years later, after milking Billions out of consumers, they come out with yet "another" XP replacement to make everything right for the millions of people who were lied to and defrauded out of their money.This is bullsh1t people., and anyone who supports Microsoft by buying another Vista FLOP deserves to be parted with his/her hard earned money., by Vegaman_Dan January 7, 2009 9:40 AM PST  Your opinion is welcomed and pleasant to read through., Your discussion points appear to be without evidence however and the value of those comments lost., Could you be more specific with background evidence to support your claim?, by Dalkorian January 7, 2009 10:22 AM PST  Wow Dan, M$ has really spent time teaching you diplomacy haven't they., by BigGuns149 January 7, 2009 11:37 AM PST  Slow?Depending upon your hardware, I would agree although I think that the performance issues are a bit overstated., While I have seen some older machines overwhelmed by Vista, a lot of the fastest OS installs and start times I have seen on a Windows machine were all Vista boxes.Unstable?I won't say that Vista can't crash, but I can say with a straight face that I haven't seen a blue screen of any kind since Vista has been released and I have primarily used Vista since late '06.I will agree that MS oversold the benefits of Vista, but I would remind you that MS oversold the benefits of XP before it, and 98 before it, and 95 before it., You have to be a sucker or an absolute newbie to not realize that MS oversells their products and that most of their product claims are to be taken with a grain of salt unless a trust third party have verified their claims.Furthermore, EVERY commercial software company NOT just MS pushes out new versions that require money to upgrade frequently., I am not a MS fanboy, but I realize that MS isn't unique in this respect., MacOS X wasn't really much good until at least 10.1 if not 10.2 depending upon who you ask, but upgrading to 10.1, which is more like what 10.0 ought to have been was a $129 upgrade., Just like Apple they have to pay their engineers to write updates., by Vegaman_Dan January 7, 2009 12:14 PM PST  Dalkorian wrote:

FYI: Win7 Beata is release 7, and not 6.1., I know it's a small thing, but it's something that stands out in the comments., by ahalemano January 8, 2009 4:44 PM PST  If Microsoft wanted to clobber the folks over at Apple, the smart thing for them to do (other than wasting millions on crappy advertisement campaigns) would be to give Windows 7 to all of those customers who bought Vista., While this wouldn't be a great financial move in terms of recouping some of their R&#38;D for the development of 7, it would go a long way in terms of instilling trust back in those customers that have shown loyalty to them all these years., One would think that they could afford to be a little generous, particularly since 7 is suppose to be the kick @$$ OS that we all expected when Vista was first released., Windows 7 is not finished., If will very likely be released next year ..., By then Apple will have two more releases out of OS-X ..., By the end of 2010 Windows usage will erode to 80% and very likely will break into the 70's ..., Remember, they secretly had OS-X for Intel and PowerPCs for every release ..., by kwhsy82 January 7, 2009 8:14 AM PST  I really liked Ishtar, Leatherheads and

stable and usable operating system than XP, which was first released in 2001."Really I never had a problem with XP., Still is today., I cant even remember the last time XP hung or BS or I had to power it down to get it to respond., So is Vista more usable when you try to run an application you own, that works fine on XP, has a problem running on Vista?, The point you were trying to make is XP is dead please move on to the new Windows...basically promoting Vista/7.When I read this I almost spit coffee on my screen..."Basic desktop performance was strong; the reports that Windows 7 is simply faster than Vista appear to be true., Certainly, Windows 7 had no problem simultaneously installing and launching applications, downloading files, browsing the Web, and carrying out other tasks on our modest 2.8GHz Pentium 4, which has only an 80GB IDE hard disk and 512MB of RAM."512MB of RAM, yeah a pure joy I am sure., Any one that has ever installed an OS knows one thing for sure., Its quick, it boots up fast, shuts down fast etc., Then you load apps, use files, temp files are created and the hard drive gets fragged....the OS slows down., I think you forgot this, and sure a clean install of Windows 7 was faster on a system with 512megs of RAM that had Vista on it for months?I agree with you here..."Microsoft appears to have wiped out a lot of the Windows XP-era interface quirks of Vista; the result is a much more simplistic, unified experience for common tasks., You would have nice new shiny dialog boxes and animations in most places followed up with stuff from XP????, So I guess Windows 7 is Vista finished in so many ways?, So for all those that purchased Vista, MS would like to thank you for paying for their beta test., Now please give us more money for the finished

	Ubuntu 10.04, Operating systems reviews Our Review, Windows 7 will go on sale to the public on October 22 2009, Update: also see our article 18 things Windows 7 does that Vista doesn't.Windows 7 is complete, but before we begin, this isn't the exact version of Windows 7 Ultimate that you'll get on a new PC.That's because there are still content deals for Media Center to lock down and it doesn't have the Windows 7 web browser ballot scren that users in Europe will see when they set up a Windows 7 PC (new or upgraded).PC builders and laptop manufacturers are also busy creating their own Device Stage interfaces for some PCs and many more peripherals will have Device Stage interfaces by the release on 22 October., But this is the final code you'll be using from day to day - the last few bugs and the debug code of the Release Candidate are gone - and it's the first time we can tell whether Microsoft has delivered what Senior VP Steven Sinofsky promised last autumn: "Making Windows 7 compelling and easier to get used to."See full-size imageWindows 7 has to woo Windows XP users who have resisted Vista by offering performance and compatibility as well as extra features, and it has to entice Vista users who feel they should have had the performance and compatibility all along by convincing them that it's more than a service pack.And given how many people have tried out the pre-release versions of Windows 7, the RTM has to dot the i's, cross the t's and feel truly finished., Can Windows 7 deliver all that, compete with OS X Snow Leopard and stave off the attack of Android and Chrome OS at the low end?, Your comments (5) Click to add a new comment, I like the Windows 7 OS except for the Windows Live Mail that I'm stuck with.Nothing but trouble from day 1., In windows 7 Car racing has been around since the dawn of gaming., But when you add a mud-flinging off-road adventure to the mix and a host of ultra-cool rigs to choose from, you?ve got loads of fun for the racing addict in your house., DIRT 2 gets an extra power boost from DirectX 11 in windows 7.So windows 7 is really amazing for gaming., Its better than Windows XP is so many ways, the biggest one being that its just looks so nice and really makes working with the PC a joy., The driver support from vendors is excellent and I have yet to find an addon that does not work.Overall, would I recommend upgrading from XP or Vista??, Is it better than Apple OS X and Snow Leopard.....I have to say now, but its a massive step in the right direction., I had none of the problems above., Worked fine for me  on a 3 year olde machine and only took around 30 minutes., I've got my Windows 7 Ultimate version from my work as an upgrade., According to the given information, this software could be installed from Windows XP 64 bit., But then after clicking install, I got the message that I couldn't perform an upgrade from XP64., The software installed itself on my machine after I created a new partition and formatted it., You have to create a new partition cause Windows wants to add a small partition of 100mb for own purposes., I tried and tried again for more than 15 times to install during which everything not essentially necessary for the computer to run was taken out (cards) or turned of in the BIOS., I heared that some people restarted the computer and at the installation message that all went wrong and I had to reinstall from the beginning, they pressed shift and F-10 and typed explorer.exe from the commandline., Then I got an idea., Immediately at the beginning of this phase, I hit the shift and F10 buttons and typed 'explorer.exe' at the commandline., I had an upgrade but performed a clean install (as the software told me to do in earlier stages)., I found a workaround on the www I could edit in the registry to get passed the registration issues., Then I noticed my external harddrive on the IEEE 1394 port was not recognized., On the www I found this to be an old problem from the Vista times., Now at last playing a bit with a working installation I've found one of the first issues why the software installation jammed., My computer is able to work around a memory hole (you can turn this on or off in the BIOS) to make the best use of the memory available., I've found that Windows 7 can't handle this and jams when this option is turned on in the BIOS of the computer., The new graphics card was not necessary.All in all, compared to for instance the up to date Linux Ubunty 64 bit software installation which performes on excellent level and can be installed by a completely non computer guy, Microsoft Windows looks great, but is delivered with an installation a big guy like Microsoft should be very very ashamed off., Tell us what you think

	Ubuntu 10.04, Operating systems reviews Our Review, Windows 7 will go on sale to the public on October 22 2009, Update: also see our article 18 things Windows 7 does that Vista doesn't.Windows 7 is complete, but before we begin, this isn't the exact version of Windows 7 Ultimate that you'll get on a new PC.That's because there are still content deals for Media Center to lock down and it doesn't have the Windows 7 web browser ballot scren that users in Europe will see when they set up a Windows 7 PC (new or upgraded).PC builders and laptop manufacturers are also busy creating their own Device Stage interfaces for some PCs and many more peripherals will have Device Stage interfaces by the release on 22 October., But this is the final code you'll be using from day to day - the last few bugs and the debug code of the Release Candidate are gone - and it's the first time we can tell whether Microsoft has delivered what Senior VP Steven Sinofsky promised last autumn: "Making Windows 7 compelling and easier to get used to."See full-size imageWindows 7 has to woo Windows XP users who have resisted Vista by offering performance and compatibility as well as extra features, and it has to entice Vista users who feel they should have had the performance and compatibility all along by convincing them that it's more than a service pack.And given how many people have tried out the pre-release versions of Windows 7, the RTM has to dot the i's, cross the t's and feel truly finished., Can Windows 7 deliver all that, compete with OS X Snow Leopard and stave off the attack of Android and Chrome OS at the low end?, Your comments (5) Click to add a new comment, I like the Windows 7 OS except for the Windows Live Mail that I'm stuck with.Nothing but trouble from day 1., In windows 7 Car racing has been around since the dawn of gaming., But when you add a mud-flinging off-road adventure to the mix and a host of ultra-cool rigs to choose from, you?ve got loads of fun for the racing addict in your house., DIRT 2 gets an extra power boost from DirectX 11 in windows 7.So windows 7 is really amazing for gaming., Its better than Windows XP is so many ways, the biggest one being that its just looks so nice and really makes working with the PC a joy., The driver support from vendors is excellent and I have yet to find an addon that does not work.Overall, would I recommend upgrading from XP or Vista??, Is it better than Apple OS X and Snow Leopard.....I have to say now, but its a massive step in the right direction., I had none of the problems above., Worked fine for me  on a 3 year olde machine and only took around 30 minutes., I've got my Windows 7 Ultimate version from my work as an upgrade., According to the given information, this software could be installed from Windows XP 64 bit., But then after clicking install, I got the message that I couldn't perform an upgrade from XP64., The software installed itself on my machine after I created a new partition and formatted it., You have to create a new partition cause Windows wants to add a small partition of 100mb for own purposes., I tried and tried again for more than 15 times to install during which everything not essentially necessary for the computer to run was taken out (cards) or turned of in the BIOS., I heared that some people restarted the computer and at the installation message that all went wrong and I had to reinstall from the beginning, they pressed shift and F-10 and typed explorer.exe from the commandline., Then I got an idea., Immediately at the beginning of this phase, I hit the shift and F10 buttons and typed 'explorer.exe' at the commandline., I had an upgrade but performed a clean install (as the software told me to do in earlier stages)., I found a workaround on the www I could edit in the registry to get passed the registration issues., Then I noticed my external harddrive on the IEEE 1394 port was not recognized., On the www I found this to be an old problem from the Vista times., Now at last playing a bit with a working installation I've found one of the first issues why the software installation jammed., My computer is able to work around a memory hole (you can turn this on or off in the BIOS) to make the best use of the memory available., I've found that Windows 7 can't handle this and jams when this option is turned on in the BIOS of the computer., The new graphics card was not necessary.All in all, compared to for instance the up to date Linux Ubunty 64 bit software installation which performes on excellent level and can be installed by a completely non computer guy, Microsoft Windows looks great, but is delivered with an installation a big guy like Microsoft should be very very ashamed off., Tell us what you think

		Our final and definitive verdict on the best Windows operating system ever, Comments (94)Comments (94) | Add yours, 5th, 2010   Windows 7 has been around for a little while now and a lot of users are using it., It was released on July 22, 2009? and as of today it accounts for 27% of traffic on my personal blog askTheAdmin.com which happens to be right up there with the damn Internet Explorer 6 share!, But if you have not taken the plunge yet, perhaps you are still debating on whether or not to jump on the Windows 7 bandwagon or maybe wait until Windows 8 shows its face?We have done the leg work for you ? reading all of the Windows 7 reviews, testing the system and bringing you the skinny on Windows 7., They have been taken from Lifehacker, Engadget and ArsTechnica., First up is the Lifehacker piece titled Complete Guide to Windows 7., When you arrive at the page you will see a full featured Windows 7 review with a lot of background from the dudes and dudettes that have been using the operating system since it was leaked way back.They discuss everything from Installation and setup to common issues, tricks, tips and links to showdowns like Snow Leopard vs Windows 7 and The top features in Windows 7., They go on to show us how to burn ISOs without any 3rd party tools and the magic being Internet Explorer 8?s new feature (only on Windows 7) that can clone a unresponsive tab ? which is utterly awesome!Our next Windows 7 review is from Engadget and can be found here., At Engadget, they get a little more nitty gritty and look at boot times (that are improved), visual enhancements and other points someone upgrading from XP would be very interested in.Reading the Engadget review showed me Aero Peak which allows you to preview open windows without clicking on them., And Aero Snap allows windows to snap together seamlessly as many of us wished for many many years ago.They go on to give other links to full installation guides and a lot of information about Windows 7 any which way you look at it.Last but certainly not least is ArsTechnica?s review of Windows 7.? I always love Ars? reviews and this time they did not disappoint either.They have a massive 15 page review (separated by links for each page?) that culminates with this tidbit that blew my socks off:Overall, it?s pretty clear that Windows 7 is ?Vista R2.? Hell, the branding of the server counterpart is a dead giveaway here., Windows Server 2008 RTM was exactly Vista SP1; Windows Server 2008 R2 is exactly Windows 7., Because the Windows Server 2008 branding is popular and successful (the OS was, quite rightly, very well-received) in a way that the Vista branding is not., And Microsoft knows it, which is why internally, Windows 7 is only version 6.1., Windows 7 is, overall, a fantastic OS., It builds on a solid platform, and just makes it even better.ARS touches on important points like branding and comparing features like UAC to Seven?s younger sibling Vista., They really do touch on everything and just like the others make for a great read.So what do you think of Windows 7?, AND FOR A LOL Check this out   ShareThis  ?The comments were closed because the article is more than 90 days old., If you have any questions related to stuff mentioned in the article or need help with any computer issue, just ask it on MakeUseOf Answers., http://www.sketch-ai.com/how-to-easily-create-a-custom-logon-screen-for-windows-with-logonstudio/ How To Easily Create a Custom Logon Screen for Windows with LogonStudio | Web Design and Graphics Resources | SEO | Making Money Online[...] (3)Windows 7 Reviews: The Only Ones You Need To Read [...] Ben@LuisYeah, after the Vista brand was thoroughly destroyed (combined effort of a very poor launch and very brutal, but successful campaign on Apple?s part) Microsoft cleaned it up and it became a decent, functional OS (albeit still considerably heavier on resources than W7 ? my netbook didn?t like Vista, but like W& just fine)., http://www.neurosoftware.ro/programming-blog/facebook-web-design/tutorial/what-you-need-to-know-about-windows-7-requirements-installation-tips/ What You Need To Know About Windows 7: Requirements & Installation Tips | Programming Blog[...] Also have a look at the following articles on MakeUseOf: Mahendra covered 15 Best Windows 7 Tips and Hacks and 12 More Windows 7 Tips & Hacks., Karl compiled The Only Windows 7 Reviews You Need To Read., [...] http://www.neurosoftware.ro/programming-blog/facebook-web-design/tutorial/cool-windows-7-wallpapers-that-you-have-to-check-out/ Cool Windows 7 Wallpapers That You Have To Check Out ?

Windows 7 Reviews: The Only Ones You Need To Read   Share and [...] W.S.BecketI doubt if the moderator would permit me to write an honest appraisal of Windows 7., Windows 7 Softpedia Review, Adjust text size:, On October 22nd, 2009, Microsoft will reboot Windows., Next week, just five days from now, Windows 7 will hit store shelves worldwide., And yet, there already are millions of users currently running Windows 7, including the gold version of the operating system., For the early adopters that have embraced Windows 7 since before Milestone 3 approximately a year ago, through the Beta Build 7000 and Release Candidate (RC) Build 7100, and every other leaked interim development release of the OS, the Windows reboot has already taken place., A new apex of Windows is now booting on production environment computers on a daily basis, including a few of the machines I?m using., On October 22nd, 2009, Microsoft will reboot its operating system to the best Windows client the company has developed since MSDOS., Some might be fooled into thinking that Windows 7 was a less ambitious project than Vista, and only a minor upgrade., To put it simply, Windows 7 is a result of realistic strategy, made public only in bite-size chunks with the tactic to underpromise and overdeliver., And make no mistake about it, Steven Sinofsky, now president, Windows and Windows Live Division, together with Jon DeVaan, senior vice president, Windows Core Operating System Division, and the thousands of developers on the Windows team, have indeed overdelivered., The legacy  Windows 7 is so far from the mess that was Vista that it is hard to believe that it is the successor of Windows XP that acted as the foundation of the latest iteration of the Windows client., Vista debuted to a barrage of criticism, some of which originated with the platform?s own testers slapping Microsoft for the release of what they believed to be an OS still far from being finalized., Appearing aimless, bloated and plagued with problems, Vista was only fixed with Service Pack 1, as far as end users are concerned., After all, make no mistake about it, dig just a little under the new, shiny Windows 7 surface and you will find Vista., And yet Windows 7 is getting nothing but love and accolades, while Vista got the boot., On numerous occasions I?ve had to sit through anti-Vista diatribes from users who had never used the operating system at all., But in a sense, Vista also acted as the perfect buffer for Windows 7., Vista simply absorbed a lot of frustration from consumers, albeit it also generated more than its fair share, but it managed to give Microsoft a quasi-clean slate for Windows 7., I don?t care what your perspective on Windows 7 is, but the platform shines when you compare it to Vista, no matter how you look at it., Editions  Just as Vista, Windows 7 comes in a variety of flavors., Here are the price tags for the main SKUs of the OS: Windows 7 Home Premium (Upgrade): $119.99; Windows 7 Professional (Upgrade): $199.99; and Windows 7 Ultimate (Upgrade): $219.99 - Windows 7 Home Premium (Full): $199.99; Windows 7 Professional (Full): $299.99; and Windows 7 Ultimate (Full): $319.99., Customers can pretty much ignore Windows 7 Starter ? unless buying cheap, hardware restrained netbooks; Home Basic ? unless living in an underdeveloped country; and Enterprise ? unless they are a Software Assurance customer looking for Volume Licenses of Windows 7., Home Premium, Professional and Ultimate is where all the heat is, one perfect for home users, one for businesses and the last tailored to technology enthusiasts., Performance  Even before Windows 7 was out of the gate it dramatically outperformed Windows Vista., And when I?m saying this I?m not even thinking of Vista RTM, but of Vista SP1 and SP2, by which time Microsoft had fine-tuned XP?s successor., Whether you?re booting or shutting down, copying content, or performing any other of a countless list of mundane tasks, Windows 7 will get the job done faster than Vista., It just looks like Microsoft integrated as much horsepower as possible into the new operating system, almost guaranteeing that customers will be thrilled by the experience provided by the new platform., Sure Windows 7 leaves Windows Vista, and even Windows XP, in the dust effortlessly, but at the same time, performance enhancements go beyond responsiveness., In fact, contributing decisively to the overall feeling that Windows 7 is snappier, completing tasks promptly, less sluggish in the most basic of actions compared to its precursor is the fact that the platform makes better use of the hardware resources available., Windows 7 will consume less RAM, and in fact it will perform under acceptable parameters with just as low as 1 GB of system memory., Not only is Windows 7 superior at administering hardware resources, but it is also better at managing services and background tasks., Because of enhanced management capabilities, Windows 7 boots, resumes and shuts down faster, but also offers increased battery life., Users with low-end machines will also be able to turn to an evolved ReadyBoost feature to add USB devices that act as additional memory cache, up to 256 GB., Compatibility, stability and reliability  Windows 7 has been built to share the same software and hardware compatibility level as the latest evolutionary step of Windows Vista., Even before finalization, the promise from Microsoft was that application and device drivers that worked for Vista would also work with Windows 7, less so when it comes down to XP., In fact, when jumping directly from XP to Windows 7 you should prepare for the worst case scenario and expect compatibility issues., The same is valid, although to a much smaller degree, for Vista to Windows 7 upgrades., The truth is that, although Windows 7 delivers impressive compatibility with legacy products, sometimes it?s just out of Microsoft?s hands., Don?t expect a seven-year-old printer for which support has been discontinued by the manufacturer to work seamlessly with your new 64-bit copy of Windows 7, because it won?t!, This is why Microsoft is supplying the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor Beta., Download the tool, scan your system, and find out before jumping to Windows 7 if your current system has compatibility issues with the new OS., As far as, stability and reliability are concerned, I have never experienced a system crash (Blue Screen) in approximately three months since I?m running Windows 7 RTM Build 7600., This week Microsoft has made available for download the first stability and reliability update for Windows 7 RTM, just to make my point., But ultimately, Microsoft has kicked up a notch the stability and reliability capabilities of Windows 7., Drivers run sandboxed to ensure that device- and driver-related crashes are contained and do not deliver a system-wide impact, the OS brings to the table a fault-tolerant heap, and evolved backup, repair and restore capabilities, now easier to leverage, even by inexperienced users., GUI, NUI and UX  I believe that only in the coming years, as the world will catch up with Windows 7, will the realization that this was the moment when Natural User Interfaces started to go mainstream will begin to sink in., The new Windows Aero graphical user interface along with the new multitouch capabilities (the natural user interface) provide a unique experience, unmatched by past Windows releases or by rival platforms., Sure enough, the new Windows Taskbar (Superbar), Thumbnail Previews, JumpLists, Aero Shake, Aero Snap, Aero Peek deliver the bells and whistled for an exceptional and unique UX., But it is the Ribbon/Fluent GUI, set as the preferred user interface for Windows 7-based apps that also boosts UX and ensures that the necessary steps are met for NUIs to become pervasive., Windows 7 is less closed and more intuitive, less opaque and more transparent, less cluttered and more organized, less rigid and more customizable, less nagging and more relaxed, less inflexible and more streamlined ? all aspects contributing to a superior user experience., Features, default applications, capabilities and functionality   I believe that Windows 7 users will be pleasantly surprised by the level of integration of Internet Explorer 8 into the operating system., The experience compares to nothing other Windows releases offer, with rival browsers still having a long way until they will catch up, but with Mozilla Firefox 3.6 leading the pack., More importantly, Windows 7 provides users with the possibility to turn IE8 off entirely, in the eventuality that they opt to use a different browser altogether., There are of course additional default apps, such as XPS Viewer and Windows Media Center, but also programs that are traditionally a part of Window, including Paint and Calculator., Across all default apps, Microsoft offers an overhauled user experience that will be exclusively Windows 7-specific., Home Group is a Windows 7 innovation that has its roots in the Longhorn project, which preceded Windows Vista., Home Group allows for computers in a household to be seamlessly connected, and for content and devices to be shared effortlessly, and accessible through each machine., Windows 7?s Libraries also contribute to boosting the access model to content on a specific computer, but also across the network, by aggregating materials from various locations., Users will be able to take advantage of new networking capabilities, which simplify the way Windows 7 connects to a network, be it wireless or PPPoE., Gamers will also be able to enjoy new experiences with the introduction of DirectX 11, which Microsoft has promised will be backported to Windows Vista, but not to Windows XP., Obviously, Windows 7 has very much to offer both under the hood and on the surface, too much so for a single review, but I attempted to mention at least some of my favorite parts of the new OS., However, there are additional heavyweight features such as DirectAccess, BranchCache, Windows XP Mode, MUI support, BitLocker, which I already covered in separate articles on Softpedia., Please feel free to use the comments section in order to share your own perspective over Windows 7., Security  It?s too early to tell whether the new performance improvements introduced in Windows 7 will stand the test of time or not., Microsoft has enhanced User Account Control, introduced the Action Center, boosted IE8 security features and is even providing Microsoft Security Essentials 1.0, a free but basic security solution to protect users running genuine copies of Windows., It is important to note, that, although a product of the Security Development Lifecycle, Windows 7 does not come close to the breath of security mitigations introduced in its precursor., It was in Vista that Microsoft built in UAC for example, and it was with Vista that the Redmond giant put its foot down and demanded hardware manufacturers to sign all drivers, and didn?t nudge when it was pressured to undo Kernel Patch Protection (PatchGuard)., Windows 7 simply builds upon the great security mitigations already available including Address Space Layout Randomization, Stack Randomization, Heap Randomization and Heap Corruption Detection., But it is important to note, that, just as Windows Vista, Windows 7 features only security mitigations, and no security barriers., This means that, although work has been done to bulletproof Windows 7 even more than its precursors, the operating system in itself is not a panacea for the threat environment., However, recent statistics from Microsoft indicate that out of all the machines Microsoft Security Essentials was installed on just 17% had been infected with malware, compared to 52% of XP and 32% of Vista computers., Conclusion  The way I planned the final thoughts initially was to offer an answer to ?Should I buy Windows 7?? After all, the scope of every good review is to make it clear whether a product is worth your money., If it?s worth your time and trouble., As I?ve said at the start of this piece, Windows 7 is a reboot for the Windows client., A reboot that introduces customers to the evolution of Microsoft?s proprietary operating system., Projects from Microsoft Research such as Midori, Singularity and Barrelfish will feed the imagination of geeks everywhere, but Windows 7 is already palpable and almost here., Windows 7 is hands down better than Windows Vista, and I have no hesitation in saying this, despite the Windows 6.0 to Windows 6.1 evolution., And while incomparably superior to Vista, Windows 7 makes Windows XP feel old and obsolete, just like an OS released in 2001 should feel., This time around there aren?t any excuses for waiting around for Windows 7 SP1., Think of Vista SP1 and SP2 as all the service packs Windows 7 has ever needed., And while perfecting the operating system is a path Microsoft has embarked on already, Windows 7 is also ready for prime time and mainstream adoption from the get go., Despite the fact that Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer has been reserved when proclaiming the commercial success of Windows 7, millions more customers will adopt the new operating system starting with the coming week., Estimating Windows 7 sales figures that will surpass Vista?s is nowhere near ?going out on a limb? on my behalf., My forecast is that Windows 7 will beat this figure, perhaps not dwarf it, but definitely enjoy more commercial success than its predecessor., For me, Windows 7 was more than worth the trouble of what must be approximately 100 upgrades and clean installs., Windows 7 was also worth the money I paid recently for a new laptop., I have already run Windows 7 for the most part of 2009 and when using Vista or XP I find myself searching for the Show Desktop shortcut in the bottom right hand side corner, trying to arrange windows side by side with Aero Snap, right-clicking icons while searching for JumpLists., For me it?s clear, I?m never going back to Vista or XP, as Windows 7 offered me a superior experience to both, and to any Linux distribution as well as Mac OS X release I?ve ever used., Microsoft Windows 7 90-Day Eval VHD is available for download here., Another Windows 7 RTM Enterprise 90-Day Evaluation is available for download here., Windows 7 RTM Starter Edition, 100-Screenshot Gallery  Windows 7 RTM Home Basic 110-Screenshot Gallery   Windows 7 RTM Home Premium 120-Screenshot Gallery   Windows 7 RTM Professional 110-Screenshot Gallery  Windows 7 RTM Enterprise 100-Screenshot GalleryFollow the editor on Twitter @mariusoiaga, In part one of our cloud computing series, we tackle the Messenger client within Microsoft Windows Live., 12 Tips to Speed Up Win 7, Windows 7's XP Mode Cuts Hardware Virtualization, Give Windows 7 a Facelift, Adventures with Windows 7's XP Mode, Can Your Laptop Run Windows 7?, Windows 7 is a Winner, Mostly, Can Your Desktop Run Windows 7?, Windows 7's Mangled Mobile Opportunity, WINDOWS 7 LATEST REVIEWS, Try online., 5GB of FREE IDrive Online Backup, start protecting your digital life today!, Free Trial

	With this first beta of its flagship OS, Microsoft makes a push for touch capabilities, easier networking, a smaller footprint, and more-complete hardware suppo..., The first thing you'll notice about Windows 7 is that it looks like Vista., It takes personalisation to extremes.Microsoft has analysed the data from millions of user computing sessions to find out exactly what people do with their computers, then attacked the "pain points" to make Windows 7 quicker and smoother., (About 15 million people used the Windows 7 beta.)The most obvious difference is that Windows 7 doesn't keep annoying you with prompts ? though it's also true that the latest version of Vista is much less annoying than the original., However, Windows 7 is vastly more secure than XP and, in any case, the threat landscape has changed since XP was trashed by worms such as Blaster and Slammer., Today, the more important security changes are in the Internet Explorer 8 browser which, uniquely, defends against cross-site scripting.Another obvious difference is that Windows 7 uses fewer resources.Where Vista really needed 2GB of memory, Windows 7 will run quite happily in 1GB on a slow dual-core Intel processor, though I'd still recommend 2GB or, for preference, 4GB with the speedy 64-bit version of Windows 7.The reduced footprint and some optimisation means Windows 7 sleeps and wakes up faster (though it's still not in the same class as Mac OS X).And laptop batteries should last longer., I've been running Windows 7 on an Asus UL30 laptop with a claimed battery life of around 11 hours with Vista: it now does more than 12 hours.Any PC that currently runs Vista will be better at running Windows 7 ? a first for Microsoft ? and it should also run on most PCs that will run XP SP2., (Search YouTube and you will find users showing off by loading it on unsuitable systems, including antiques with Pentium III chips.) The catch is that upgrading a PC running Windows XP requires a clean installation of Windows 7: you can't do an in-place upgrade., This has been a source of complaints, because it means reinstalling all your applications as well.However, we've known for a dozen years that a clean installation of Windows usually works better, and geeks have generally recommended it.Indeed, people used to reinstall Windows 95, 98 or Me just to clean up their systems, so it's silly to get hysterical about it now.The Windows 7 interface has a few noticeable changes., Second, the QuickLaunch area and the TaskBar have been replaced by a sort of combo-pack.Instead of putting applications in the QuickLaunch area, you can now right-click and pin them to the new-style Taskbar, alongside running applications.As in Vista, hovering over a Taskbar icon shows one or more mini-previews, depending on how many windows you're using, except now they're interactive., Hovering over a mini-preview shows it full size on the desktop, while right-clicking provides a Jump List of options.It makes it dramatically easier to see what you are doing., However, if you are an inveterate Alt-Tabber, that shows the same mini-previews., And if you liked Vista's Flip 3D feature, that's still an option.Incidentally, you can now move TaskBar icons around to change the order, like browser tabs., As I always try to keep XP TaskBar items in the same order, I find this useful., It's a small point, but Windows 7 has lots of small points, and they add up.There are a few party tricks that Windows 7 users can show their friends, such as Aero Snaps, Aero Peek and Aero Shake., Aero Peek makes open windows temporarily transparent so you can see what's on your desktop., All are both useful and fun.The My Documents section has been reorganised under one heading, Libraries., This includes Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos, with Windows 7 sorting things into these "shell folders"., This makes it easier to keep stuff you want to share away from stuff you want to keep to yourself.Sharing is an important part of Windows 7., It has a HomeGroup feature that makes it very easy to set up a home network and share things., It only works with Windows 7 machines, which I expect will sell a few family packs of Windows 7 (three copies of Home Premium for ?149.99).Right-click a photo, for example, select Share, and this gives you four options: Nobody, HomeGroup (Read), HomeGroup (Read/Write) and Specific People., "Plays to" lets you display a video, for example, on a different PC.Support for the consumer electronics industry's DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) standard should help Windows 7 PCs work with other devices, though I've yet to see an example.There are also some "location awareness" features where Windows 7 figures out where you are ? on a home network or an office network, for example ? and selects the appropriate printer., One example is "adaptive brightness": if your PC has a light sensor, Windows 7 will adjust the screen brightness to match.Multi-touch is also supported, if you have the hardware to take advantage of it., Technically, several standard applications have also been removed from the operating system, though I expect most PC manufacturers will install them.What Microsoft has done is decouple the Windows Live Essentials suite of applications ? Mail, Messenger, Photo Gallery, Movie Maker, etc ? from the operating system., It means the Live programs can be updated from the web every six or nine months, or whatever, instead of on a three-year operating system development cycle., It also reduces the attack area for anti-trust complaints.But one thing that's missing from Windows 7 is the Microsoft Security Essentials anti-virus program, formerly codenamed Morro., You get Windows Defender and an improved firewall, but Microsoft appears to be too scared of the European Commission to do what would be best for users and include anti-virus software as well., As it is, specialist anti-virus companies install trial versions on new PCs, and pay PC manufacturers very handsomely for the distribution., If Microsoft did the right thing and defended users for nothing, it would upset the financial applecart.All round, then, Windows 7 is generally good, and some Windows fans reckon it's better than Apple's Mac OS X., Also, Windows 7 ? released to companies on August 6 ? has so far proved to be a lot less buggy than Apple's Snow Leopard, which has even lost users' data.If you dig into Windows 7 you will, of course, find numerous relics from the past, going right back through Windows 95 to DOS.There are lots of inconsistencies that still need cleaning up.However, Microsoft's business depends on running millions of programs that stretch back decades, supporting vast numbers of peripherals, and providing a platform for thousands of competing manufacturers who make everything from handhelds and tablet PCs to racks of data-centre mainframes., That's just the baggage Windows carries.But with luck you will not see too many of these relics, and on the surface, Windows 7 is impressively smooth.I'm a full-time Windows XP user who didn't upgrade to Vista on my two main PCs, but I can't see a good reason for sticking with XP now that it looks doomed., I've bought a cut-price Amazon Windows 7 Pro upgrade for my desktop, and I'm planning to buy a new Windows 7 laptop to replace my very old ThinkPad X31.Windows 7 is a long way from being perfect, and it's not an essential upgrade if you're happy with XP., Windows 7 is simply the best version of Windows you can get., Comments ()?

be annoying (I am one so should know) but they have a point., Having finally got fed up with Vista about a month ago I made a wise choice and downloaded Linux's Ubuntu (for a grand total of ?0)., Only

3., MS keeps rearranging the furniture on the user and I hate it., From what I understand, people began to like the XP interface after several years of working with it., Hunting for utilities with new names in new locations in a new OS like Vista and W7 destroys productivity., Offering a family of products ranging from "Home" to "Enterprise" has functionality strewn in different locations with different names., Like with Vista, I've had a nightmare of a time with W7 trying to get it to accept network printers.Vista is such a bad product that tweaking is like tweaking a turd., I need the thing to work and not menace the users or techs., W7 barely works as a useful environment.I have never used a Mac, but I've managed to sell a number of users on them in the last year., W7 has completed my conversion to Apple that Vista began., I still haven't used an OSX machine but can't wait to start., I know that Apple is a company that understands that elegance is made of simplicity and visibility., MS will never get that., "the more important security changes are in the Internet Explorer 8 browser which, uniquely, defends against cross-site scripting."Uniquely?, The Firefox add-on "No Script" has been providing this feature for a long time (yes XSS cross-site scripting, not just javascript).Not so unique.Might want to edit that bit out, you'll be turning people away from genuinely secure browsers in favour of that old bag of hole IE., Vista was poor (I liked XP a lot though) so hopefully W7 will get it right, but OSX is not infallible and considering the premium one pays to get it, it should be kicking W7's arse every day of the week., Oh yeah, MS got feedback form 15 million ravenous MS nerds to help tweak W7., They are the worst foundation of knowledge imaginable for developing a friendly OS environment.Microsoft has made my work a slow, grinding hell., It'll be yet another insecure mess that requires constant attention: my money will be spent on hardware for my Ubuntu linux....with which my computer behaves itself just as reliably as my phone!, I'm disappointed that Microsoft is still clinging to the almost 20-year-old Windows Registry rather than doing what almost every other OS does and simply keep all the application settings in the same place where you can find them., Also, it is still slower than Mac OS X Snow Leopard, which both dramatically slimmed down the installation and boosted the speed.But with what Microsoft is currently selling 7 Professional for in the US in educational markets ($30 to download plus $12 for the disc), I finally decided to buy my first ever copy of Windows., It will live on my MacBook Pro along with Snow Leopard, where it can at least perform tasks for which software is either MIA or weakly implemented on the Mac., Motorola Phone Tools; certain third-party firmware upgrades where there's no option for using Mac OS or Unix Terminal; potentially Visual Basic in Excel if I come across a spreadsheet that defeats the more limited version of Visual Basic in NeoOffice., Windows 7 has been available as a free download for months., In fact if you search around you can still get hold of the free version and it will run until end of March next year.Personally, I don't think Vista is quite as awful as people love to make out, particularly if you have a modicum of technical competence and are able to configure it more to your liking.I will be upgrading my XP machines to W7 in the near future., I won't be buying MACs, they're far too expensive and I hate the way Apple dictate what hardware I can use., given it has been available for months and those who pre-ordered it seemed to get it days ago these people seem odd -http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8319083.stm, I've been using Windows 7 since August, thanks to my MSDN licence., Granted the UAC was too invasive and the driver support was poor, but Vista worked for me and I liked it.However, the problems Vista did have were enough to damage its reputation beyond repair., Windows 7 has been as much marketing work as programming, despite the fact that it's almost identical to Vista., Having said that, maybe it's been good for Microsoft and forced them to concentrate on polish, rather than poorly-implemented new features.As for Mac OS, I own a MacBook Pro as well as several Windows PC, and it's great., Apple does have the advantage of tight hardware integration and makes good use of it, but let's face it., Safari became unusable on my machine for months thanks to an Apple update.Each OS has its merits., The Amazon "cut price" upgrade at ?147.95 for 7 Pro currently offers a massive 5p discount over the full version., That's a lot of money to pay for the functionality and speed  I should have had with Vista in the first place., I'd happily pay ?40-50 to get away from Vista, but this is robbery.t's even more ridiculous when you consider that for ?250 Dell will send  Windows & Pro round loaded on nice new PC., Well I played with all the open betas for Windows 7 and was so impressed that I bought it., ?45 for a brand new operating system that I like is good value for money, in anyone's book., It's great for games, it's stable, it's polished and it does the job well., I'm running the 64-bit version and drivers are abundant and generally stable (ATi need to get their act together!).As for Microsoft "Moving the furniture around and hurting productivity", is it such a bad thing?, Was life easier in Windows 3.1 when you couldn't right click?, Ypnos -Was life easier in Windows 3.1 when you couldn't right click?Adding right-click didn't require moving anything., You needn't even know it is there until you actually right-click., Not great, but OK.As for Aero and the new W7 graphic toys, who cares?, I turned off Aero as it was annoying and just have it as XP would have displayed., DX11 is also potentially appealing if it still allows 5+ year old games to run properly.And be careful with leaving your job maradonut86, these days a masters is nothing and certainly more so in the post 2008 bank collapse world., "Right click a photo, for example, select Share, and this gives you four options: Nobody; HomeGroup (Read), HomeGroup (Read/Write),"What pointless functionality, doesn't Flickr, Facebook etc., Windows 7 is already a dinosaur., I have been using Windows 7 since the RC release on all the PCs in my house and can't fault it., I am currently awaiting the doorbell which will announce that the courier has arrived with 3X Home Premium and 1X Professional.As for all the comments from all the fanboys and inepts ("I installed Windows 7 and it blew up 2 of my machines") I am just quietly smiling to myself and have nothing to say., Ubuntu is getting a lot of endorsement these days, I notice., I wonder how long it will be before the Microsoft drones start droning on about smug Ubuntu snobs with their charcoal pullovers?, I use Open Office in preference to MS Word for this reason alone..., glad you think 7 is better than vista - but then you thought Vista was good when it came out as well"Jack Schofield replies:Vista is prettier, easier to use and more secure..."probably best to take a schofield view of any MS product with a pinch of salt, You really did not discuss the multimedia capabilities of Windows 7., How well Windows 7 handles interfacing with email attachments of media, You Tube and accounts like Flickr!, I'm sticking with Ubuntu.Does everything (and more) that Windows 7 can do., I'm a full-time Windows XP user who didn't upgrade to Vista on my two main PCs, but I can't see a good reason for sticking with XP now that it looks doomed."Techradar seem to think XP offers much, much more battery life, and, to quote them "There's nothing to stop third-party programs from injecting code into one of the privileged Microsoft executables, such as Explorer, in order to gain full elevated access to the machine without displaying any User Account Control prompts" which isn't good., Personally I'd stick with XP until this is resolved, though Vista users might want to whisk over for a shufty., Think Ubuntu!, Would not touch Windows 7 for the considerable future., Was considering going back to XP SP2 (the most stable MS-OS) if only I could locate the license key., I will be using Ubuntu from now on.........so everyone Think Ubuntu!, i got a boxed install disc from amazon yesterday and ran an install on the Sos laptop., all went well.But i have a few questions, i though MS had to do a browser ballot to allow you to choose what was installed, i got IE installed and that was that?, then the default search engine is Bing and it took a little searching to find a plugin to change that to Google.Other comments, why is it all Windows Live?, i am not interested in sharing photos on the internet, etc.On the whole it works, and unlike the install of Snow Leopard on my Macbook Pro it doesn't crash when it comes across a flash heavy website.Do i want to use windows full-time, no, it is better than Vista, alot better, but i still prefer the way OS X does things.As for Ubuntu, tried it and don't like it, and there is a major issue with VBA which i use in Excel, support is even worse than on a Mac., AxisOfEvilI'm sticking with Ubuntu.Does everything (and more) that Windows 7 can do.Will it run Call of Duty?, ;)Linux nowadays is pretty, relatively easy to use, but utterly useless to a home user, unless they only ever browse the web or type up documents., Linux is only really good for certain types of work and web/mail servers., Anything else is a niche market and that is why it fails to break into mainstream.ElliottCBAdding right-click didn't require moving anything., You needn't even know it is there until you actually right-click.Weak argument., Anyone who did not use pre-Win95 OSes would be lost without right-click., My point was that what looks like "moving the furniture around" and an annoyance now, will probably prompt the same question in the future as the right-click one., khamsini though MS had to do a browser ballot to allow you to choose what was installed, i got IE installed and that was that?, i am not interested in sharing photos on the internet, etc.I saw nothing about Windows Live until I purposefully installed it., You can turn sharing off, in the sharing center.On the whole it works, and unlike the install of Snow Leopard on my Macbook Pro it doesn't crash when it comes across a flash heavy website.12 minutes from installing to being in Windows!, Is it possible to use Windows 7 with the keyboard only (as it has been with all Windows before Vista)?Have they got rid of those terrible 'context enabled' file manager windows., Those that automatically decide that you have a directory full of video, for example, and so restrict what details are shown?I work in the video industry and have numerous video clips, however I need to see 'date and time of modification', size, etc., It was OK in XP, but severely broken in Vista., I ended up using a third party search application (Agent Ransack), the search is so bad in Vista (mind you, that fact that already in XP, the fact that only one of the search options was 'files and folders' already showed that MS was loosing the plot - everything is either a file or a folder, nothing else exists on a computer)., I use quite alot of technical progs heavily, But no in place upgrade is a pain., It will take me ages to configure all my apps on a new 7 machine.More importantly I'll waste loads of hours working out why something isn't working, then to spend further hours trying to remember the setting that sorted it.Thats why I image disks for backups I'm up and running straightaway.@freedomsstain - pls don't bang the Firefox drum., However now its unstable, upgrades fail and as with all open source the options get spread around all sorts of places.More importantly uses loads of resources., Stopped using IE 4/5 years ago - didn't like it too much tied into OS was delighted with Firefox., Its got so flakey now that I've gone back to using IE (something I thought I would never say)., On the plus side easy to fix - just keep a backup of its directory.@decisivemoment - I thought with more .NET programs the registry would become more redundant, dlls and their interfaces stored in .NET world  there with xml files being glorified ini files., @YpnosLinux nowadays is pretty, relatively easy to use, but utterly useless to a home user, unless they only ever browse the web or type up documentsAfter a few too many machine-out-of-the-window moments with Vista, I went to Ubuntu (having had Fedora Core 10 on an old machine for a while)., I can do everything I used to be able to (music, video, office stuff etc) with Vista, but reliably quickly and for free., Er go, it's very useful to me as a home user and would be useful to most of the home users I know., The installation is as straightforward as Windows and, with the exception of iPlayer, everything worked straightaway (even iPlayer only took about 15 minutes looking on the net to sort out).I'm not saying Ubuntu's better than Windows, as it's clearly a matter of taste, but to suggest that it's only good for web and word processing is completely incorrect.Admittedly you can't play games on it, but that's what Wiis are for..., " the more important security changes are in the Internet Explorer 8 browser which, uniquely, defends against cross-site scripting."It's not unique at all., Firefox and Opera have protected you against these for a VERY long time...., You said yourself you only use it for office stuff, music and videos ;)As regards games, one could argue that ipods and portable DVD players are for music and video playing :)I definitely agree with you about Vista though., Okay: I have a five-year-old PC with an AMD Athlon 3500+ processor (2.2GHz), and 2Gb RAM., Will W7 run okay on this box, or will I have to replace it?, MS says yes of course it will; PC World says not a chance.What would be the chances of running a dual-boot with XP?, with XP I used to want to hit my computer,now ubuntu makes me want to fondle it ;oP, I guess my point is what do home users do on their PCs under Windows that they can't do under Linux?, Apart from using hardware that requires proprietary software (eg iPod and iTunes, but there are ways round that) I can't think of anything the average home user would want to do that they couldn't do on Linux., Pre-ordered copy of 7 Home Premium arrived from Amazon today., Not impressed by Live Movie Maker as it's more basic than the old Windows Movie Maker.Ubuntu?, I use the machine mainly for work (inc writing a lot of VBA code) and some photo-editing, but I don't play games on it, so it sounds as though I probably do have enough power., I won't be updating my three primary Windows XP machines anytime soon because of the ridiculous upgrade path from XP to Win7.There is no upgrade path.I would have to move all my data off the C drive (actually my important data is always on external drives anyway) but I am not inclined to wipe each PC, install Win7 and then reinstall all of my software from scratch on each machine and then tweak each program with my personalised setting and preferences such as Actions in Photoshop.I don't have the time., And can you imagine a large business with thousands of XP PCs having to wipe every users PC and start from scratch?, A long and extremely expensive process.I will be building a new Windows workstation soon, and I can still get OEM versions of XP until 2011, so I am pretty sure I will stick with XP Pro for the foreseeable future., If you do upgrade your memory, bear in mind that 32-bit Windows only sees up to 3GB of RAM (at least that was the case with Windows XP)., 64-bit will see up to 128GB of RAM., I've had a play with the Beta and it did seem markedly quicker.@JackAny chance of an article on next week's, ahem, big release?, Now there is a nice litle toy that somo people call an OS.Vista is bad?, want better performance buy better hardware.Bought today windows 7, didnt even seen it :P as always i will not be disapointed.But every one should try other OS and many more should be forced to work with them, maybe that way you could see how good is realy windows., click here to log out, Prologue: A troubled past
A bit less than three years ago, Windows Vista was officially launched after a long delay., The  operating system brought a raft of long-overdue new features to the Windows platform to make it truly fit for hardware of the 21st century., The changes were all well and good?the graphics work in particular was essential to allow Windows to offer functionality equivalent to that found in Mac OS X for many years?but they came at a high cost., To take advantage of all the new features required the use of all-new Windows Vista hardware drivers., In spite of the extended development process and lengthy open beta, many vendors were apparently caught off-guard by Windows Vista's release and its preference for new drivers, so they chose  to ignore the new OS for many months.Software vendors didn't fare much better., Vista's new User Account Control (UAC) system meant that most of the time even administrators were stripped of their full privileges, forcing all software to run as a regular user account; full access was only provided after a confirmation prompt., Take those privileges away, and the programs start breaking., As for its impact on users, Vista also brought with it higher hardware demands that caused many to recoil in horror., This wasn't a new phenomenon, of course; Windows XP and Windows 2000 before it both had the same effect., So big, so bloated, so slow?these are traditional criticisms leveled at any new Windows release, and Vista was no exception., In truth, Vista's hardware requirements were not egregious; the problem was that in comparison to XP's ancient, five-year-old requirements, Vista's requirements represented a big step up, especially in the area of video hardware., So when Windows Vista became publicly available in early 2007, the reception was rather lukewarm., Third-party hardware and software support was spotty, backwards compatibility was reduced, and system demands were markedly higher., This led to a computing public that clamored for the continued availability of Windows XP, and many businesses (chipmaker Intel among them) swore off the new version of Windows in favor of its ancient predecessor., Sure, the new operating system had teething trouble, but this was nothing new., XP also got booed
Long-time Windows observers will remember that XP's reception was immensely hostile, and for substantially the same reasons; users migrating from Windows 98 found that the new Windows didn't work with their hardware, didn't work with their software, ran slower, and used more memory., Business users similarly saw little compelling reason to migrate from Windows 2000 (which was then less than two years old), as XP offered them relatively little., The thing that XP had on its side was time., XP should have been replaced by Windows Longhorn in 2004 or 2005, but the cancellation of the Longhorn project and subsequent wait for Vista meant that everyone?users, software developers, hardware vendors?treated Windows XP as the main (or even only) version of Windows, with the result that everything worked with XP., The early woes were forgotten, and XP, old and clunky as it was, became the version of Windows that everyone loved and adored (or at least, tolerated)., Just as XP was fundamentally not as bad as its initial reception would lead one to believe, the same was true of Vista., Stripped of the Vista name and placed in front of unsuspecting users, "Windows Mojave" was warmly received., And even corporate customers have started to migrate to the OS., Vista was progress, and it paved the way for Windows 7
Although Windows Vista may have caused vendors and users alike some amount of pain, it was all for a good reason., To take advantage of modern video cards, Windows needed a new graphics stack; to withstand the increasing malware onslaught, Windows needed to tighten security and make running as a regular user more comfortable., These changes were not made lightly; the break with the past was necessary to put the operating system on the same footing as its competition and to address long-standing, legitimate criticisms of the platform., Microsoft was never going to revert to a more XP-like operating system, no matter how desperately some cling to the old OS., Indeed, in this writer's view, Vista was far and away the best version of Windows ever shipped; the searchable Start menu alone ensured it received that accolade., I have way too many icons in my Start menu and way too many documents on my PC for hunting through hierarchies to ever be an effective way of finding, well, anything., And it's like crack; I was hooked from the first time I ever did it, and using Windows XP (with its dumb old-fashioned Start menu) feels like stepping back into the 1980s., The Start menu wasn't the only positive change in Vista., The new video subsystem, for example, meant that I'm no longer beholden to the likes of NVIDIA or ATI for my computer's stability., In a similar vein, upgrading video drivers without rebooting is now a reality., It was a major overhaul of the platform, and in retrospect, it's not entirely surprising that the transition was somewhat imperfect., Third parties could, and should, have done better, but they have at least caught up now., Read more stories, December 2010 Patch Tuesday will come with most bulletins ever, Internet Explorer 9 gets new anti-tracking privacy feature, Silverlight 5 unveiled: many new features, direction still vague, Click here to view the 487 comments on this story, Call +877 466 7165, Call +877 466 7165, Call +808 101 9217, Call +800 603 576??, Call +877 466 7165, You are here: Home ?

After a year of displaying the Siamese Fighting Fish, aka Betta (get it?, One startup characteristic that disappoints me is that the sound is identical to Vista's startup sound., The default theme of the interface has its own new look, yet Vista users will feel mostly at home., Even upgrading XP users will have little trouble with the UI, but neither will they be able to cling to the past., Basic and High Contrast options let you simplify the visual presentation for low-powered machines or no-nonsense-type users., But there's no XP emulation Theme in Windows 7, as there is in Vista, although there is a Windows XP Mode in the Professional and higher versions that allow for XP emulation?more on that later., The taskbar also has more noticeable changes; for an in-depth look at this new interface cornerstone, check out Jason Cross' insightful article, "The New Windows 7 Taskbar.", You can choose whether to combine all instances of one app in one button or keep all separate, or to combine them only when space is short on the taskbar., They also display side-by-side thumbnails with filenames of any documents the app has open, and full-size previews when you hover the mouse pointer over a thumbnail., Finally, an option lets you pin (or permanently set) a taskbar icon so that it's always present., That's a good thing, since Quick Launch icons have disappeared in Windows 7., The Windows 7 Start menu is nearly identical to Vista's, except that applications can now display what's called a Jump List when you hover the mouse pointer over one's entry., Note, however, that it works only for the large Start menu choice, not when you click on All Programs, and it only works for programs that specifically implement it., Another Start menu difference is in the options that appear to the right of the program list: Network and Connect to are gone, and a Devices and Printers choice has been added., Presumably, Microsoft now trusts users to visit the Network and Internet control panel for networking tasks., If your screen is covered with application windows, the new Desktop Peek function can reveal these gadgets by making all windows on the desktop transparent when you hover the mouse in the lower-right corner of the screen., I prefer the explicit nature of the Show Desktop icon in XP and Vista, rather than the nonintuitive clicking on the unmarked corner., Another such enhancement is the new behavior that maximizes a window when you drag it to the top of the screen., If your desktop gets cluttered and you want to focus on the one window you're looking at,"Shaking"?clicking on the top window bar and moving the mouse rapidly from side to side?minimizes all other windows on the screen., Another Aero enhancement lets you move two windows to opposite sides of the screen to fill exactly half the screen with each., For this to work, you have to grab the title bar with the mouse pointer and drag it all the way to the edge of the screen., I'm not thrilled about dragging a window to the display's top edge to maximize it, but if you resize one just enough to hit the top or bottom edge, the window will maximize vertically only?quite useful., Double-clicking still maximizes the window, too.?Next: Libraries, The most commented posts on Engadget over the past 24 hours., Google under fire for promoting own content ahead of competing websites,

Deserved or not, Microsoft had dug itself a cool, deep, dark hole with Windows Vista., Users demanding that Redmond extend the life of Windows XP wasn't exactly something they could be proud of, either., Bombarded by complaints and negative press even after the first service pack was released, the bar had been set high for Vista's successor: Windows 7., This review is based on an official copy of the Windows 7 RTM that Microsoft provided to CNET on July 30, 2009., Luckily for Microsoft, Windows 7 is more than just spin., Importantly, it won't require the hardware upgrades that Vista demanded, partially because the hardware has caught up, and partially because Microsoft has gone to great lengths to make Windows 7 accessible to as many people as possible., It's important to note that the public testing process for Windows 7 involved one limited-availability beta and one release candidate, and constituted what some have called the largest shareware trial period ever., As buggy and irritating as Vista was, Windows 7 isn't., Instead, it's the successor to Windows XP that Microsoft wishes Vista had been, and finally places it on competitive footing with other major operating systems like OS X and Linux., Microsoft is offering six versions of Windows 7: Starter, Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate, OEM, and Enterprise., The three versions that Redmond will be promoting most heavily are Home Premium, Professional, and Ultimate, although Starter will also be available to consumers., Windows 7 will support both 32-bit and 64-bit systems., The bare minimum requirements for the 32-bit include a 1GHz processor, 1GB RAM, 16GB available hard-disk space, and a DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver., 64-bit systems will require at least a 1 GHz processor, 2GB RAM, 20GB of free space on your hard drive, and a DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver., Do note that some users have claimed to have limited success running the Windows 7 beta with less than 1GB of RAM, but that's not recommended., Installation

Microsoft is offering several paths to install Windows 7., People can buy a new computer with the operating system already installed, upgrade from Windows XP or Vista, or do a clean install on a computer the user already owns., The clean installation took us about 30 minutes, but that will vary depending on your computer., The upgrade procedure is different depending on whether you're running Windows XP or Windows Vista., Vista users merely need to back up their data before choosing the Upgrade option from the install disc., Both XP Home and XP Pro users will have to back up their data, then choose Custom from the install disc., Custom will have the same effect as a clean install, although it'll save your old data in a folder called Windows.old., Once you choose Custom, you'll need to select the partition of your hard drive that contains Windows XP, and then follow the instructions to enter your product key and allow the computer to reboot as needed., If you're not sure if your current computer can run Windows 7, you can download and run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor from Microsoft., Features: Taskbar and Aero Peek Although the look of Windows 7 may seem to be nothing more than some polish applied liberally to the Vista Aero theme, make no mistake: This is a full replacement operating system, and more than just "Vista done right." From driver support to multitouch groundwork for the future, from better battery management to the most easy-to-use interface Microsoft has ever had, Windows 7 is hardly half-baked., This is one of the best improvements Microsoft has made--third-party program dock makers are going to have to do some serious innovation when Windows 7 goes public., It features pinned programs using large, easy-to-see icons., Mouse over one and all windows associated with that program appear in preview., Mouse over one of those preview panes to reveal an X to close the window., Hover over the preview to show a full-size preview of the program, or click on the window to bring it to the front., Jump lists are another new taskbar improvement that make recently opened documents easier to get to., Right-click or left-click and drag on any program icon pinned to the taskbar to see a list of files that you've recently used in that program., In Internet Explorer, this will show recently visited Web sites, although it doesn't yet seem to work in Firefox., Mouse over to the right corner., Click on the box to minimize all your programs., Aero Peek shows the desktop when you hover over the right edge of the toolbar, and is also an option in the program-switching hot key Alt+Tab., (This image was taken from the Windows 7 Release Candidate, but looks and functions the same in the official version of Windows 7./Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)
  Resizing programs has been simplified and improved by the capability to drag a window's title bar., Drag a program window to the top of your monitor to expand it to full screen., Dragging a program away from the top or sides will return it to its original size., This is an entirely new feature in Windows 7, but it should prove easy to adopt because it mimics and expands on the maximize/restore button that people have been resizing windows with since Windows 95., Theme packages also make it much faster to change the look of Windows 7., Click on one to download it, and it instantly changes the color scheme and background--no need to reboot., Windows Media Player and Device Stage One of the biggest new features makes Windows Media Player useful again: you can now stream media files from one Windows 7 computer to another, across the Internet and out of network., When you open Windows Media Player, there's a new Stream option on the toolbar., When you've associated a second Windows 7's WMP with that same ID, you can remotely access the media on the host computer., Microsoft reinvigorates the Windows Media Player by allowing users to stream their media files to themselves., All it takes is two Windows 7 computers, an Internet connection, and a free Windows Live ID., (This image was taken from the Windows 7 Release Candidate, but looks and functions the same in the official version of Windows 7./Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)
 Hide Review Next page  
The new Device Stage makes managing peripherals significantly easier, combining printers, phones, and portable media players into one window., A large photo of the peripheral summarizes important device stats and makes it easy to identify which devices you're using., Device Stage can also be used to preset common tasks, such as synchronization., Device Stage support for older devices makes one of Windows 7's best features applicable to peripherals and externals that don't need to be upgraded., One annoying change is that Bluetooth driver support no longer comes baked into the operating system., Search, touch screens, and XP mode Windows 7's native search feature has been improved., Files added to the hard drive were indexed so fast that they were searchable less than 5 seconds later., Search result snippets now include a longer snippet, and highlight the snippet more clearly., This should appeal specifically to people who juggle large numbers of long documents, but it's a useful feature for anybody who wants to find files faster., However, the search field is available by default only in the Start menu and in Windows Explorer, and cannot be easily added to the taskbar., Search snippets do a better job of highlighting relevant terms in your documents, exposing useful data even if it's not in the file name., (This image was taken from the Windows 7 Release Candidate, but looks and functions the same in the official version of Windows 7./Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)
  Touch-screen features worked surprisingly well., The hardware sometimes misread some of the multitouch gestures, occasionally confusing rotating an image, for example, with zooming in or out of the image., Overall, though, there were few difficulties in performing the basic series of gestures that Microsoft promotes, and this places Windows 7 in an excellent position for the future, as more and more computers are released with multitouch abilities., Experts and people or companies who hope to use Windows 7 for business situations will appreciate the new XP Mode., It doesn't have much of a practical application for the home consumer, but if you need to access programs designed for Windows XP that have not been upgraded to Windows Vista or 7, XP Mode creates a virtual environment within Windows 7 that should assuage any fears of upgrading without backward compatibility., Windows 7 supports a feature that won't be useful to most users, but businesses might do a double-take., XP Mode is a free add-on for Windows 7 that creates a virtual XP environment in which you can run older programs., (This image was taken from the Windows 7 Release Candidate, but looks and functions the same in the official version of Windows 7./Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt/CNET)
  It's not easy to set up once you've downloaded the XP Mode installer., You'll need to double-check that you have the right hardware, and can get the right software., Motherboards older than two years probably won't work, and even if you do have a newer one you might have to go into your BIOS and activate Hardware Virtualization., Users will have full access to peripherals connected to their Windows 7 hardware, including printers, and the clipboard can be used to cut and paste between the virtual operating system and the "real" one., Security
User Account Control, or UAC, is back in Windows 7., UAC was one of the biggest changes in Vista., Windows 7 provides more options for user customization of UAC., The default setting is to notify users only when programs try to make changes to the computer, one step below the most restrictive setting of Always Notify., Under Always Notify, anytime a program tries to access the Internet, or you try to make changes to the computer, Windows 7 will require user confirmation., The second-least restrictive option doesn't dim the desktop when UAC is activated, and will only notify the user when programs try to make changes to the computer., When the desktop dims, Windows 7 is locking it down and preventing access., Never Notify is the most relaxed option, and is only recommended by Microsoft for programs that aren't compatible with UAC., UAC also displays a blue banner when confronted with a program from a known publisher versus a yellow banner and exclamation point when the program is from an unknown publisher., The number of clicks it should take to use UAC safely has been reduced, However, it's important to note that it's a less aggressive default posture by UAC., Unlike Windows XP and Windows Vista, Windows 7 will no longer AutoRun external hard drives and USB keys when they're connected., This kills off a risky vector for malware infections that has been the bane of many security experts., Although Microsoft is working on a revamp of its antivirus and antimalware program, now called Microsoft Security Essentials, it won't be bundled with Windows 7., Users are still required to download a third-party antivirus and antimalware program, although the Windows Firewall remains intact., As with many features in Windows 7 that have been carried over from Windows Vista, people will notice there's far more granular settings control than before., Features like filtering outbound traffic, which were available in Vista but not exposed, are easier to access in Windows 7., Minimum hardware

Windows 7 feels faster than Windows XP and Vista, but it turns out that's not always the case--sometimes, it's the slowest out of the three operating systems., CNET Labs tested four 32-bit Windows operating systems: Windows 7 RTM build 7600, Windows 7 Release Candidate build 7100, Windows Vista with Service Pack 2, and Windows XP SP3, all on an Inspiron Desktop 530 Mini Tower running an Intel Core 2 Duo Processor E4500 at 2.20 GHz, with a 128MB NVIDIA 8300 GS graphics card, 4GB of RAM, and two 320GB SATA 7,200rpm hard drives., Microsoft Office Performance (in seconds)(Shorter bars indicate better performance), Windows Vista SP2 (64 bit)

4,217?, As you can see in the chart, we found that Windows 7 RTM was the fastest to shutdown, and was tied with XP for iTunes encoding., However, it was slower than XP and Vista for both booting up cold by a bit more than 1 second, and slower than either of its predecessors in its Microsoft Office performance., After having used Windows 7 beta, RC, and now the RTM for more than six months combined, it still feels faster for us when launching programs, opening the control panel, and dragging icons, files, and folders around than XP., That's not to denigrate the value of the benchmarks, but keep in mind that the perception and reality might differ based on hardware and usage., Support
When you try to use a file already in use, Windows 7 goes beyond Vista and XP by telling you not just that it's being used, but where it's being used so you can manage the situation faster., Other than that, Windows 7 offers on-board operating system support nearly identical to Windows Vista., Screen darkening, one-click action hand-holding, and a useful question mark icon on all Explorer windows maintain Vista's improved help features, when compared with Windows XP., In sum Windows 7 looks like the operating system that both Microsoft and its consumers have been waiting for., By fixing most of the perceived and real problems in Vista, Microsoft has laid the groundwork for the future of where Windows will go., Windows 7 presents a stable platform that can compete comfortably with OS X, while reassuring the world that Microsoft can still turn out a strong, useful operating system., Login or register to post commentscheap ugg boots sale

what will be interesting to see is how 7 compares with the other two OS using a newer proc with hyerthreading and on an SSD since apprantly 7 is optimized for that., other than that, as was mentioned earlier, it isn't all about the "raw numbers." as has been my experience, 7 has been much better in every way but even if it was just a few percentage points slower than my xp partition, i would have still wiped it off my system, which ive done now  =)

This is all nike air max 2011 well and good., I'd never begrudge someone their drive to earn a living online., But in the process of clamoring to write nike air max 2010 reviews tons of articles and saturate the Web, a simple truth has gotten buried., Writing a good nike air max 2010 red article is still the best way to build traffic, gain a solid reputation, and take your online success to new heights.Having been an airmax 2010 black article writer and marketer for over a decade, I can tell you with certainty that the best grey nike air max 2009 articles I've ever written have also been the best performers in terms of gaining my nike air max 2009 yellow site backlinks and traffic., A good article will continue bringing in visitors for months - even years - after you wrote it., Writing an article that you've just thrown nike air max 2009 cheap together often ends up in oblivion very quickly.If there's one guiding principle to writing good nike air max 2009 mens running articles, this is it, and it isn't as easy as it nike air max black white sounds., The temptation to turn article writing into a numbers game is tantalizing and seductive., Most of us fall for it, especially when we're just starting nike air max 95 mens running shoe out., For example, many online marketing forums will have air max 95 black multiple threads at any given time with members bragging about how many yellow airmax articles they can write in a day., The notion that it's all about quantity seeps into a lot of minds this way., Login or register to post commentsAnd finally there?s

Windows 7 is awesome except the Windows Audio Feature that was crippled since Vista., In Windows XP, I could use the Windows Audio to record my sound card's 'What U Hear' in exact audio quality using any audio software., I think i'll just give up on Windows Classic WAVE audio recording and start using the ASIO feature on my sound card, though I still prefer using old software since they are lighter and the Windows 2000 and XP Mixer is equally good if you have a high end sound card., Now with the restrictions and the cripple of Windows Vista's sound support, they make it difficult to do that, the audio quality isn't exact anymore., Microsoft should have included all the compatibility with all?Windows Vista drivers and software., I wish my original vista driver CD would still work on Windows 7., The only reason why I still use XP is the audio recording dilemma., Login or register to post commentsPerfect

I read a few posts below about windows 7 taking away some of the GPU power for the system and I have to agree fully.? What a load of shit.? I tried out benchmarking in passmark with both os (xp-32, win7-64) and while on xp it will show full gpu usage, windows 7 showed capped at 80% and it wouldn't go higher.? What is this crap microsoft?? Aquamark did the same thing except hitting 84% for a second.? That would explain why i'm getting less FPS in games with win7 over xp.? I play resource hungry games that need all I can give them and windows 7 just isn't cutting it.?

After 5 minutes of Google searching I found a potential answer to your problem, along with the guy below.? I won't know for sure unless you post back with your system specs, but I have a suspicion that you're running an nVidia card.? nVidia hasn't released good drivers for Windows 7 yet.?
Anyone running ATI graphics doesn't seem to have your issue., As
proof, I'd like to point out this article written by a professional
overclocker and benchmarker.? I recommend reading the introduction,
then looking at the Aquamark scores (especially since this is the benchmarking tool you said you used).? After displaying a graph where Win XP falls behind all of the newer OS's, his analysis is: 
?"One important thing to note about Aquamark3 in particular is that there
is a heavy dependence on graphics drivers., On nVidia GPU?s, XP is
actually slightly ahead of the others., You?ll have to take my word on
that since nVidia results aren?t included in this roundup, but
curiously enough, running ATi in Windows 7 scores about equal to a
comparable nVidia setup in XP."

I have three comps...one has a pentium proc and 96mb ram (HP Vectra VA), the next has an Athlon X2 2.6Ghz OC'd to 3.2Ghz w/2GB DDR2 1066 RAM,? The third, has a Phenom II X4 955 OC'd to 3.7ghz w/4GB 1066 DDR2 RAM...both the 2nd and 3rd comps run an EVGA 280GTX (one each), PC Power & Cooling 750w PSU, and 300GB Velociraptors (not RAID)., Now here are FACTS:
1.? I can install and run XP on the HP Vectra...it ain't pretty or fast, but it does run (YES!, even with 96MB RAM)
2.? I have full retail versions of XP VISTA and WIN7...all three in 32 and 64 bit flavors., 3.? I do a little of everything on my comps...aka? surfing, gaming, audio / video editing and conversions, etc etc., 5.? Win XP 32 bit....will simply smoke any other available OS...in any task., 9.? Number of viruses and/or trojans in past 8 years on XP 32 bit.........ZERO !!, My primary partition has approx., 10gb of data on it, (page file, music, pics and videos are on separate HDD., With my lowly AMD proc, no RAID, and Norton Ghost 2003, I can make a complete (after cleaning) Primary partition IMAGE backup in 3 minutes....I can restore from ANY NG 2003 backup in 2.5 minutes.? Try THAT on Win7 with any backup software, including Win 7's., MOST people hailing the wonder that is Windows 7 are comparing it to an XP install thats probably years old., ? ?? Sure in 4-5 years, with a few Service packs, and many more 64bit apps, Win 7 may beat XP...but then MS's new flim-flam, aka Win 8 will be out.? Here's the real deal when it comes to computers and the internet......, 2.? They will make wads of money selling that information to the highest bidder!, ? ?? THIS IS WHY MS releases new OS's...well that and their bottom line.? MS is not out to make YOU a better, faster, more secure OS.? They are in fact doing the exact opposite, for the sole purpose of making more money and watching what YOU are doing on your computer.? To diguise this fact, they flash up the GUI with pretty colors and pics, then get the Billy Mayes of MS (Ballmer) to explain how MS is only looking out for you and the ease of your computing tasks., ? ?? No, I'm not going to cite proof, I made my own proof.? The big difference here, is that I have NO vested interest in the outcome or benchmarks and such.? I am retired and own no stock in ANY software or hardware company.? I do NOT receive "freebies" for good reviews.? At my age I have no ego to cater to...I just want my OS to work fast and flawlessy, w/e I throw at it.........speed, security, compatability, GUI....thy name is Windows XP Pro 32bit.? Heck, it even over clocks easier and faster., ? ?? I'm not dissing anyone elses opinion here, the above are simple FACTS that I have spent years (Vista), months (Win 7) testing.? If I was NOT retired and was still making money, hand over fist, I too would probably throw it all at the latest and greatest....as reviewed,? but since I am on a fixed retirement income, I have to use my brain instead of my wallet.? More importantly I have to THINK, test, retest etc., and then go out and buy what WORKS best.....not what someone TELLS me works best., Final Note:? You all, of course remember Windows ME....now ask yourself....did MS (with their 20K, 6-7 digit salaried coders, truly THINK that ME was a GOOD thing.? The same can be said for Vista....maybe Win 7 will be different, who knows....but until it can out do XP in ANYTHING.....I can wait on MS to go back to the days when they cared about the users, more than they care about their bottonline and watching everything you do on your computer.? I think the "honor" left Microsoft when Bill Gates stepped down, so to speak., ?
Little fact for you to think about: ?? Did you know that when you uninstall Google Earth that it leaves behind, over 50K registry entries,? and ONLY JV16 Power Tools seems to be able to remove them and even it can't get them all., Oh, almost forgot....UAC stands for USER account control....I did NOT know that Microsoft was a "user" on my computers.....funny that? :)

XP works and is stable plus it runs all the SW I use, works with virtually any version of windows, and no problems noted with Linux or Macs (all on a network).? With enough service packs and "maintenance releases" W7 may eventually be something useful.? The new explorer is terrible and that has been one of the primary reasons I have kept XP, the rest are well noted in your post., I have been doing IT work from the days of Win 3.0 and seen all the variations and there have been many dead braches on the Windows family tree, Anyone remember Win3.0, ME, NT4 SP5 (tended to kill Exchange servers)?? All caused more problems than they fixed, and good to see MS doing beta testing on the users dime, how many of you bought Vista or W7 or got it on a new system (price included in the cost of course)?, W7 should have been a free upgrade to ALL Vista users, and not just a home premium version, but Ultimate.?

	Ubuntu 10.04, Operating systems reviews Our Review, Windows 7 will go on sale to the public on October 22 2009, Update: also see our article 18 things Windows 7 does that Vista doesn't.Windows 7 is complete, but before we begin, this isn't the exact version of Windows 7 Ultimate that you'll get on a new PC.That's because there are still content deals for Media Center to lock down and it doesn't have the Windows 7 web browser ballot scren that users in Europe will see when they set up a Windows 7 PC (new or upgraded).PC builders and laptop manufacturers are also busy creating their own Device Stage interfaces for some PCs and many more peripherals will have Device Stage interfaces by the release on 22 October., But this is the final code you'll be using from day to day - the last few bugs and the debug code of the Release Candidate are gone - and it's the first time we can tell whether Microsoft has delivered what Senior VP Steven Sinofsky promised last autumn: "Making Windows 7 compelling and easier to get used to."See full-size imageWindows 7 has to woo Windows XP users who have resisted Vista by offering performance and compatibility as well as extra features, and it has to entice Vista users who feel they should have had the performance and compatibility all along by convincing them that it's more than a service pack.And given how many people have tried out the pre-release versions of Windows 7, the RTM has to dot the i's, cross the t's and feel truly finished., Can Windows 7 deliver all that, compete with OS X Snow Leopard and stave off the attack of Android and Chrome OS at the low end?, Your comments (5) Click to add a new comment, I like the Windows 7 OS except for the Windows Live Mail that I'm stuck with.Nothing but trouble from day 1., In windows 7 Car racing has been around since the dawn of gaming., But when you add a mud-flinging off-road adventure to the mix and a host of ultra-cool rigs to choose from, you?ve got loads of fun for the racing addict in your house., DIRT 2 gets an extra power boost from DirectX 11 in windows 7.So windows 7 is really amazing for gaming., Its better than Windows XP is so many ways, the biggest one being that its just looks so nice and really makes working with the PC a joy., The driver support from vendors is excellent and I have yet to find an addon that does not work.Overall, would I recommend upgrading from XP or Vista??, Is it better than Apple OS X and Snow Leopard.....I have to say now, but its a massive step in the right direction., I had none of the problems above., Worked fine for me  on a 3 year olde machine and only took around 30 minutes., I've got my Windows 7 Ultimate version from my work as an upgrade., According to the given information, this software could be installed from Windows XP 64 bit., But then after clicking install, I got the message that I couldn't perform an upgrade from XP64., The software installed itself on my machine after I created a new partition and formatted it., You have to create a new partition cause Windows wants to add a small partition of 100mb for own purposes., I tried and tried again for more than 15 times to install during which everything not essentially necessary for the computer to run was taken out (cards) or turned of in the BIOS., I heared that some people restarted the computer and at the installation message that all went wrong and I had to reinstall from the beginning, they pressed shift and F-10 and typed explorer.exe from the commandline., Then I got an idea., Immediately at the beginning of this phase, I hit the shift and F10 buttons and typed 'explorer.exe' at the commandline., I had an upgrade but performed a clean install (as the software told me to do in earlier stages)., I found a workaround on the www I could edit in the registry to get passed the registration issues., Then I noticed my external harddrive on the IEEE 1394 port was not recognized., On the www I found this to be an old problem from the Vista times., Now at last playing a bit with a working installation I've found one of the first issues why the software installation jammed., My computer is able to work around a memory hole (you can turn this on or off in the BIOS) to make the best use of the memory available., I've found that Windows 7 can't handle this and jams when this option is turned on in the BIOS of the computer., The new graphics card was not necessary.All in all, compared to for instance the up to date Linux Ubunty 64 bit software installation which performes on excellent level and can be installed by a completely non computer guy, Microsoft Windows looks great, but is delivered with an installation a big guy like Microsoft should be very very ashamed off., Tell us what you think

Rahul Manekari, I love you Windows 7 you're so beatiful, Ramesh Kumar 
Thanks for reviewing Windows 7 !, The bottom line: Anyone looking for an alternative to the iPhone, but who wants better multimedia features and a more organized user interface than Android offers, should look at the Samsung Focus with Windows Phone 7, which has all that plus solid performance and a sleek design., The bottom line: The HTC Surround features the high-quality design that we've come to expect from HTC, but the only thing its built-in speakers really add to the phone is weight., Reviews

	23 October 2009 16:11 GMT / By Duncan Geere

	Is Microsoft's latest OS up to scratch?, Most people agree that its last operating system release, Windows Vista, was actually a perfectly respectable bit of software once driver manufacturers were on board after a year or so, but that didn't stop it becoming the butt of almost every single one of the tech industry's jokes since 2006 (that weren't about the Zune).This time round, Microsoft has taken a decidedly different approach to the launch of the OS., In stark contrast to the relative secrecy of the Windows Vista release, combined with a marketing campaign with the slogan: "The Wow Starts Now", the launch of Windows 7 has been totally open and subject to very little marketing.Many technology enthusiasts, ourselves included, have been running 7 in either its Beta or Release Candidate version since early 2009., The OS hasn't changed significantly in that time, but a few features have been tweaked and improved upon, and we've been running the final release of the OS now for a little while.As such, we've got a good idea of how it runs in both the short and long-term., We've worked with it, played games with it, and this review will aim to answer three main questions - "is it any good?", "should I install now, or wait a year like with Vista?" and "is Ultimate worth the price over Home Premium?".So let's start with the first thing most people will experience - the install procedure., For a long time Microsoft has been trying to cut down the amount of steps required to install its operating systems and Windows 7 seems to have stripped the whole thing down to the bare minimum.The whole process is mercifully brief - slightly longer if you want to upgrade from Vista rather than reformat your hard disk (required if you want to switch from XP or any of the early releases of Windows 7)., You just pick a language, pick a drive to install on, and that's it!, It's wider, and the start button no longer says "Start" on it, but it functions mostly the same as it always did with one exception - the quicklaunch area and the list of running programs have been merged.Now, when you launch a program its icon appears along that list and mousing over it will give you a preview of what the window looks like., In some cases, you'll also be able to interact with that program, thanks to "jump lists" accessible with a right-click., These lists include options like skipping between tracks on a music player, or setting status on an IM application.This seemingly minor UI improvement actually increases productivity quite a bit., We found that after using Windows 7 for a bit it was actually a little bit painful to go back to Vista., Windows 7 is a genuine pleasure to use, and seems to suffer considerably less than its predecessors from random crashes and blue screens.Media streaming is another big deal in Windows 7., Straight out of the box you can have a hard disk chock-full of content (acquired legally, obviously) and then share that media with other Windows 7 devices on your network, or even over the web., A biref download lets you link a Windows Live account with your Windows account, and from there you can use Windows Media Player to send audio and video wherever you like.You can share particular libraries from Windows Media Player 11 and 12, from Windows Home Server, but most excitingly of all you can hook up a DLNA-enabled television or stereo and see it appear as a device on your network to stream music to., From there, you can just right-click tracks and send them to your television, for example.Windows Media Centre is mostly unchanged from its Vista incarnation, but has a few nice features that you may find useful., There's a whole pile of media extenders available that are a bit like Firefox Extensions - they can enable additional functionality.For example, if you have an Xbox 360, you can install an extender that lets you view all your computer's multimedia content on your Xbox., Windows Media Centre is a well-put-together bit of software that should cover most of your audiovisual needs in the OS.Those of you who are purchasing the Ultimate edition of Windows 7 will get a few extra features too., There's BitLocker encryption for drives if you want to protect particular content from prying eyes., This offers AES encryption algorithm in CBC mode with a 128 bit key, combined with the Elephant diffuser for additional disk encryption specific security not provided by AES., If you're not sure what that means, then it basically means "you're not breaking into this one".If you're upgrading from Vista to 7, you'll have relatively few of the problems that you might have run into between XP and Vista., 7 uses almost exactly the same architecture, meaning that if something worked in Vista then it's more-or-less likely to work fine in Windows 7 too., In fact, it's fair to say that if your device doesn't work in Windows 7 or Vista now, then the blame can only be pinned on the manufacturer - they've had nearly four years to get things working., The only issues we faced were linked to running a 64-bit operating system which, while supported pretty well, didn't have quite the same catalogue of drivers as the 32-bit edition.And if the worst happens, and a program defiantly refuses to work then Ultimate edition also includes an XP Mode that lets you virtualize the aging OS inside Windows 7., From there, anything that worked on Windows XP will work, though you'll suffer a slight performance degradation.Those who experiment a lot with different operating systems will also find Windows 7's virtual hard disk booting a boon., This allows you to section off a bit of your drive and pretend that it's an entirely different hard drive, allowing you to test out alternative operating systems without having to partition your drive., It's a bit like Boot Camp in OS X - allowing you to run more than one operating system with ease.There's now widespread support for more file formats., Microsoft seems to have tried very hard to make Windows as compatible as possible with a wide range of different bits of hardware and software - a task that's not trival for it to accomplish thanks to the huge ecosystem of software developers that code for its platform and the sheer weight of users that go for Windows.We don't really do benchmarks or overwhelm you with graphs here - instead we prefer to tell you what kind of experience you'll get., With Windows 7, performance is great., While Windows 7 isn't as lightweight as the latest Linux builds, it behaves beautifully on both weak and powerful machines alike., We found Windows 7 perfectly operable on systems that Vista struggled with., Give it a try on a netbook or old laptop to see what we mean - you'll likely be impressed.You might have to turn off Aero mode, which is the translucent window edging that you'll see in many screenshots of Windows 7., Try it and see.Windows 7 doesn't waste the capabilities of top-end hardware, either., While you might lose one or two frames per second on the latest games compared to the same hardware on XP, you'll benefit from considerably better security and usability than Microsoft's 2001 OS., We found games performance unnoticably different in real terms from XP and considerably better than Vista., Gamers have nothing to fear from Windows 7., Windows 7 is the best OS Microsoft hasever made, and they've learnt all the necessary lessons from Vista., While it doesn't have some of the slickness of OS X, or the speed of Linux, it offers a fantastic compromise between the two with by far the biggest choice of software available.But if you're happily running XP or Vista, is it worth the upgrade right now?, Despite Microsoft's wide-open testing process, once the final version of Windows 7 hits the big, bad, world there's sure to be one or two glitches that show up and need patching.Lastly, is it worth shelling out for Ultimate over Home Premium or Professional?, On this one, we'd probably say that for most users it's not., If you're using software that refuses to work in Vista and Windows 7, but worked fine in XP and you need the virtualization mode, then you could be swayed., But most users don't need those things and will be happy with Home Premium or Professional.Microsoft, probably as a result of being such a big company, can be a little schitzophrenic with the quality of its products., Latest in SoftwareNEWS WEBSITE OF THE DAY ?

Ever since Microsoft released the first and only Windows 7 beta, there?s been a lot of hype around the new operating system - we had an early look at Windows 7 shortly after the beta came out back in January and came away impressed., This was in stark contrast to Vista?s long road to release, which saw delays, feature culling and a final product that wasn?t everything it should have been., Combine that with the horrible driver support from many manufacturers (and especially Nvidia from a gamer's point of view) and you have a recipe for disaster., Not surprisingly, most PC users stuck with their old friend Windows XP., Microsoft recognised this, and it looks as if it has listened to consumers? major bugbears with Vista., Vista?s problems started long before you even got around to installing the OS though - the mess of versions really didn't help consumers make the choice that best suited their needs (or maybe it did, by keeping them away from Vista?, Microsoft had gone from the simple three-tiered approach adapted for Windows XP - Home, MCE and Professional - to no fewer than five versions of Vista, and a confusing choice of four in the shops., Worse still, some versions lacked features that were present in cheaper versions, making people think the whole version scheme was a sneaky ploy to make people buy the exorbitant Ultimate Edition., Windows 7 takes a step back from Vista?s craziness, with just three main versions ? Home Premium, Professional and Ultimate ? with clearly defined feature sets., Windows 7 Home Premium establishes a baseline feature set, with the pricier versions adding more features., Crucially, no features are removed as you move up the price scale as they were on Vista, so every version of Windows 7 includes Media Center, for example., Microsoft includes both 32-bit and 64-bit editions of each version in the full retail box, but we?d recommend skipping the 32-bit version if your CPU supports x86-64 extensions, as it enables you to address more memory and register space, which can result in better application performance., Many applications have 64-bit executables to deliver extra performance, but Windows 7 supports both 32-bit and 64-bit applications, so you shouldn?t see incompatibility problems., For example, Photoshop Elements 7 doesn?t have a native 64-bit executable, yet it still runs flawlessly on 64-bit Windows 7., Windows 7 version comparison
A fourth edition, Windows 7 Starter, won?t be sold in shops and will only be pre-installed on netbooks., This naturally doesn't follow the same feature set as the fully fledged versions of Windows 7 - but it doesn't need to, frankly., The number of applications running concurrently has been limited to three, Aero mode has been removed and so has Media Center - these are hardly likely to cause problems a netbook, but we will be looking at running a full version of Windows 7 on a netbook very soon., Home Premium is the best choice for most people, but there are reasons to look beyond it, even if you?re not running a business., For example, even the 64-bit version of Home Premium is limited to addressing a maximum of 16GB of system memory, and it can only be used on single-socket systems., If you?re running a dual-processor workstation, you?ll need Professional or Ultimate., Professional and Ultimate also include Windows XP Mode, which runs a fully fledged version of Windows XP Service Pack 3 in a virtual machine., This is a great addition for businesses who are concerned that their applications won't run natively in Windows 7 because it enables them to run in a familiar environment., However, there is one more provision that you need to consider on top of buying a more expensive version of Windows 7 - you will need a CPU with built-in virtualisation support, otherwise the virtual machine will not start., Microsoft has made it easy to upgrade from one version of Windows 7 to the next ? you can use Microsoft?s Windows Anytime Upgrade (WAU) system to upgrade on the fly., Admittedly, WAU pricing isn?t as attractive as buying the right edition in the first place ? the upgrade from Home Premium to Professional costs ?120., Add that to the ?65 or so that you paid for Windows 7 Home Premium in the first place, and you pay almost 25 per cent more than if you?d chosen the right version first time around., Windows 7 Games Compatibility Testing, Get Windows 7 for ?30, Steve Ballmer, Microsoft CEO, announced that Windows 7 beta is available from today to MSDN and Technet subscribers., A public preview version will be available on Friday January 9th 2009., Over the next few weeks we will be looking into Windows 7 features, so far we have published the following overviews:Windows 7 Federated SearchWindows 7 UACWindows 7 Calibrate MonitorOver the new few weeks we will be adding many more focus items on Windows 7 including Touch, Internet Explorer 8, Windows 7 networking and media enhancements., Here is a quick review of Windows 7 Beta.My PC Configuration Intel Quad Core Q9400 @ 2.66GHz 8GB RAM nVidia GeForce 9800 GT 24" Monitor - LG246WH Flatron DisplayI chose to install the 64bit version.InstallationThe installation was very simple and it just took 20 minutes., The thing which surprised me was that Windows 7 had installed most of the drivers for my PC, unlike in Vista where I had to insert manufacturer's disc to install drivers., This saved a lot of time to get started with Windows 7!Windows 7 DesktopBelow is the screenshot of the default Windows 7 desktop., Nothing fancy, pretty neat and tidy:SuperbarAnd the quite famous Superbar looks fabulous:Microsoft introduced thumbnail previews of applications in the Taskbar in Windows Vista, and this has been improved a lot with the new Superbar., You might have probably seen the demo at CES or PDC.Start MenuThe Start Menu has also undergone some changes:The default behavior of the Shutdown button is now indeed Shutdown and you can easily change that by accessing the Superbar properties:Desktop (right-click) MenuThe next immediate change I noticed is the desktop right-click menu., How simple is that?Appearance and PersonalizationThe Personalize option in the desktop menu now takes you directly to change your desktop background, themes, window color and screensaver., Windows 7 also lets you create personalized Themes, which I think is in its initial stage:With Windows 7 desktop you can select multiple pictures for your desktop background., Users had to use 3rd party applications to have a slideshow in their desktop background in previous versions of Windows, and now Windows 7 does the job for you:Aero PeekThe 'Show Desktop' button is now shifted to the right end of the superbar., The right end corner of your desktop is very useful in the sense that if you hover your mouse to the right end corner, Windows 7 gives you a sneak peek of the open windows in your desktop:Superbar NotificationsWith Windows 7, the user is in total control of the notifications that pop-up occasionally(and sometimes always)., These notifications can be very easily customized now in Windows 7:GamesHas anything changed in Games?, The first time the user opens Games, the user is presented with game updates and options:I also noticed somethig new - Game Providers:Devices and PrintersThis is an interesting location in your Windows 7 desktop which shows all of your connected devices and printers., It also provides the ability to troubleshoot if there is anything wrong., When I say connected devices, it not only refers to external devices connected, but also the other internal devices like the monitor and internal hard disk:In my screenshot above, you can notice a yellow icon near my hard disk device., This indicates that there is some trouble with my device., The details pane of the window shows more information about the problem:How easy is this to troubleshoot?, Just right click the device and choose the Troubleshoot option to troubleshoot., The troubleshoot wizard tries to identify the problem and provides options if any., Just click on the wireless network icon to see what networks are available and choose to connect:You can also choose to connect to the selected network automatically:Enter security key if its required for your network and you are connected:Windows HomegroupWindows Homegroup is a new feature introduced in Windows 7 wherein you can share your music, pictures, documents, videos and printers with other machines in your home network., Anyways, visit here to learn more about Windows Homegroup.Windows 7 seems to be much improved than Windows Vista in lots of areas and the beta clearly shows that Microsoft has indeed taken users feedback on Vista seriously., I would recommend everyone to try Windows 7 Beta atleast once if you haven't yet, especially if you dislike Vista!, Please Log In or  Register to post a comment., Please enter your reason for reporting this comment., -

		I thought aero peek was the thing were you hover the mouse over the 'show desktop' button and it shows the borders of all the windows and the desktop?, That and the 'x' button in the "previews", that means one less click to close a window., -  09 January 2009 - 01:12

		Nice overview, sounds exciting., I am quite eager to try out the beta version now, Review: Windows 7 Is Microsoft?s Best Yet, Microsoft?s loyal customers are finally getting the operating system they deserve with Windows 7, and it was well worth the wait., First, to provide full disclosure (as critics have requested in our previous Windows 7 write-ups) yes, I am indeed a Mac user., But until heading to college, I grew up on a steady diet of Windows., (I made the switch after a system crash that resulted in the loss of an enormous school project.) With that said, Windows 7 thoroughly wowed me, dissolving the grudge I?ve held against Microsoft for many years., The latest OS from Microsoft delivers a truly next-generation interface that will transform the way we use our computers, while addressing a number of nagging issues that have turned off Windows users in the past., The best decision Microsoft made this time around was listening to its customers., The company crowdsourced feedback and distributed a free Windows 7 beta to Microsoft enthusiasts back in January., The result is an OS designed to beautify PCs both old and new, while retaining many of the features Microsoft fans have adored about Windows and removing many major annoyances., Read the rest of Wired?s Windows 7 review on the Wired.com Product Reviews site., $120   ?  microsoft.com

7 Good Reasons to Switch to Windows 7
7 Reasons to Avoid Windows 7
First Look: Windows 7 Shapes Up as Microsoft?s Best OS Yet ?, He's also writing a book about the always-connected mobile future called Always On (publishing April 2011 by Da Capo)., blog comments powered by Disqus, Is this an ad I?m commenting on?, Home Page > Computers > Operating Systems > Windows 7 Review, You are missed, and the Start menu is full of articles for our productivity., To be honest, we do not know what state the planet pride not on our operating systems robust functional people from Redmond have over the years, and while Windows Vista is showing in a position that Microsoft does not "t invincible he has not to show anything, such as Windows one idea - and more of a necessity - it's all in danger., Windows 7 enters three short years after Vista, the support of the shortcomings of its predecessor and to chew over, perhaps a bit 'about., We must play with the operating system as the beta with the release candidate and, finally, the last "release to manufacturing (RTM) edition in our paws dirty., And 'till his campaign and understand the expectations implicit a great live release of Microsoft?, Install / boot times / shutdown
It is the basic operating system functions., But first impressions matter, and Microsoft made sure that Windows 7 give a beautiful shine when it came to these things., You can read our complete installation instructions for a thorough look at the pitfalls and triumphs of Windows 7 in this department, but in short, quick and easy, but the real performance can be found on netbooks and clean installations., Otherwise there is really nothing to Vista to shame - even though the incredible fresh air really does a clean install, providers should cruftware-happy for a little bit "of consciousness to fix., UI enhancements
Because Windows 7 is a kind of rationalization under Vista - the same hardware requirements, hardware compatibility, same model, a bit 'less cruft - you have the basic user interface for the most visible additions to Microsoft's operating system will be similar ., Here are some of the highlights:
Aero Peek
Anyone who used a modern operating system for more than five minutes has been reached with the hassle of juggling too many windows, and Aero Peek is trying to alleviate some., Available with a machine capable of "rules of fantasy" graphics windows translucent Aero Peek lets you hover over a "desktop" on the ground shows the right of the taskbar and shows the contours of every window currently open - which usually returns chaos., Check out the demo video below to see as is done in practice:
Aero Shake
What we initially thought it was just a gimmick has become one of the more popular: just type in the title bar of a window and give it a vigorous shake to minimize all other windows., Start Menu
Mac OS X could have spotlight, but Windows now offers a quest for a strong and direct, and the Windows key has a new life., Just pop open the Start menu and type in your search results and begin to fill., It is not as comprehensive as Spotlight, but it seems to be facing the same slowdown in Mac OS X counterpart, and leads to basically what we (applications, will as a rule)., The Start menu has been enhanced with a sophisticated layout and additional menus for frequently used items - allows access to the last article is used by this application, with the new "list of activities that Microsoft has crept into the operating system but that currently used by only a few Microsoft applications built., Aero Snap
Perhaps our favorite day of improvement and offers a surprising Snap smart way to work with Windows, click with the simple strength and endurance., Windows can, with the top of the screen, or moved to a half of the screen is filled by drawing on the far left or right edge of the screen can be enlarged., Schematics Aero Peek-style, you can preview what you're doing, and it is quite clear to bounce the "sticky" edges, or drag a window already maximized away from its moorings., Windows key + right arrow or left does the same to fill half the screen with the current window, and is perfect for the document to arrive., ?New Taskbar
This gets all the press, but it's actually more the product of Aero Peek nothing intelligent in itself., Basically you take some ideas from the Dock in Mac OS X as the larger symbols and obligations App Launcher (icons may be "locked" to remain in place when the program is open or not, a merger of Windows' Quick Launch taskbar old correct), and adds in the Windows taskbar, traditional activities such as entering open windows., The standard function is good, that keeps everything "stacked" in their icon, but the real money is to be combined in the "applications when full view ", which is accessed from the Taskbar Properties., This brings the advantages of the verbose name of the elements - always a great victory over approach Icons for Windows, Mac OS's - without functionality Aero Peek fancy or cute icons., Even worse is the fact that you have a file of an app icon in the taskbar, not in this file with your application to to open it asks if you to pin "of the files, App., With a bit "of work, you can re-add the old style quick launch series of Mini Icons-drag dropability, but this is rather silly., For example, it is strange that there is no built-in support for multi-finger trackpad - why is something that third party to discover for yourself?, Two finger scrolling in particular: it is best to click on something, since the trackpad tap to arrive, and we believe everyone should have now shown that., On the multi-touch, support for Windows 7 multi-touch screen interaction is commendable, but hardly sufficient., Microsoft itself has shed much R & D in the finger-friendly interface, and we hope they will be building that innovation is the OS of today - the release of the surface of inspiration Microsoft Touch Pack is a good start, but not go far enough., One shudders to implement random innovations Multi-Touch Smartphone style, we are sure you will see a group of manufacturers in the years to come., For simplicity of most of its interfaces, commonly used measures were slowly emerging as the menu buttons, bars, though old, while the advanced features were hidden by the "menu" real in other parts of the surface., All this would not be so bad if Microsoft was the only provider of software for Windows, but because thousands and thousands of developers, widely diverging interfaces for Windows applications, we would be pleased if Microsoft took a little more direction and more clearly defined user interface design language that is coherent and useful to users., Notable app changes
Windows Media Center
?We've gone way in-depth on this over at Engadget HD, but suffice it to say that Windows Media Center in Windows 7 is vastly superior to Windows Vista's version, and most all of the bugs from the Windows 7 beta seem to be ironed out quite nicely., The interface is a real treat, the extender functionality to the Xbox 360 and 3rd party boxes is much improved and quite snappier, and a truly marvelous amount of hardware is supported., The good news is that Microsoft has greatly expanded the codec support, to something bordering on comprehensive:
?Pulled from Microsoft's Engineering Windows 7 blog What's even more fun is the new "Play to" function, which can beam a locally-controlled audio playlist to computers that are part of your HomeGroup, DLNA devices like the PS3, or Media Center Extenders like the Xbox 360., Remotely shared libraries are also automatically detected off of DLNA or Home Server devices, and everything pretty much "just works." If you're really feeling crazy you can tie your media library to your Windows Live ID and access your home media from anywhere over the internet., Windows Explorer 
?It 'hard to say that the most basic changes to the file explorer to do in this release, other than "work" much more often than they did in Vista to quantify., He is smarter long file types are available in fixed panel, preview music, images and video (if you know the preview window again), and we are certain files to drag and drop objects matching the left leg of the favorites simplified " and "libraries" more often., Unfortunately it is not all rosy, some media, we knew, "said" Zune and disabled people to play in Windows Explorer, the operating system is perfectly able to play through Windows Media Player preview his power was in some way., Internet Explorer
?We'll be honest: we avoid IE like the plague, and recommend you do as well., Microsoft continues to make improvements to the browser, and the nagging, over-protective "training wheels" approach to security is probably appropriate for those naive enough to use this thing, but the fact is that there are too many faster, better and "free-er" browsers out there to really waste much time in Microsoft's default., Anecdotally, the browser hard crashed a couple minutes into us writing this paragraph., Notable app omissions
Windows Mail 
It was never the highlight of the OS, but Microsoft has for some reason decided to ship Windows 7 completely without a mail application, unless you count the browser., You're encouraged to download Windows Live Mail with the Windows Live Essentials app pack, but while it does an alright job, it's hardly a first string effort, and we're not sure why Microsoft has decided that emailing people isn't really a core functionality of a modern operating system, much less something that Microsoft should have an industry-leading app for inside the box., We actually have a bit of a soft spot for Microsoft's no-frills approach to movie editing for the everyman, and if YouTube is any indication, Movie Maker certainly gets the job done for a lot of people., Windows Live Photo Gallery
You guessed it, another one kicked to Windows Live Essentials land, where supposedly "essential" apps go to die., Unfortunately, this particular app seems an even more logical omission, given its too-strong ties to a Windows Live account (something we've owned for years without managing to upload a single photo to, strangely enough)., Microsoft raises anti-trust laws, claiming that it is difficult to make in all "service work" when their applications bundled with the operating system will, but I would say that most of its applications could with a little " do more "open" when it comes to services (Flickr, YouTube, everything is not Windows Live, etc.) has in any case., In any case, many computer manufacturers into an agreement with Microsoft or Google or someone, some of these needs offer to come with their computer costs, but we can not help but think that Microsoft is leaving some important elements of the system operating negligible incomplete and inconsistent experiences open all these types of applications in this way., Security / networking
?Microsoft had already done a lot of work since the initial release of Vista on not bugging us incessantly with pop-up security nags, but Windows 7 strikes an even better balance., In the end we'll find out just how secure Windows 7 is once it's in the wild and hackers start hammering on it, but with the abundance and ease of Windows updates these days, most anybody with an ounce of common sense and a speedy internet connection should be able to steer clear of danger., ?On the networking front, HomeGroups are a new Windows 7-specific method of simplifying networking between computers on a local network, and we're really in love., After decades of being stymied by complicated Windows networking setups, we've finally been able to reliably and rapidly connect multiple computers and share files / media / printers / whatever without resorting to a sneakernet or inviting our smarter friends over with their fancy Computer Science degrees to figure it out for us., Compatibility
Check out our upgrade guide for more info on our specific compatibility issues, but the long and the short of it is that anything we found to work in Vista seemed to work just fine (in some cases better!) in Windows 7., That goes for hardware and software, but of course the real test will be when this OS is unleashed upon the masses -- your mom's brother's 25 year old printer might not make the cut, and we'll be sure to pour out a 40 upon its behalf., ?In truth, Microsoft does a very good job with keeping a truly insane quantity of hardware and drivers and vendors happy, but we still think they could do better., New and improved utilities to detect and install hardware are present in Windows 7, but they still don't feel entirely smart enough -- we had to track down plenty of drivers manually, and even dipped a toe now and then into the (shudder) Device Manager, which has hardly received an improvement since World War II., There has to be a better way to make sure people don't have to be smart, patient and lucky to get all their hardware working with their OS., Stage new device that seems to illustrate the importance of this issue., Microsoft has introduced a sort of coating on the outside to the Device Manager devices and printers, display devices is recognized as large icons, lickable display, and allows you to drill down into other functions with a right click or double click if you " Feeling Lucky., Unfortunately, there is a limited number of devices operating system seems very comfortable., Of course, it takes almost everything we can to USB, searching for the driver on the Internet and install smoothly, but the actual functionality of the usually very want to plug - a double click usually gives us only the driest driver management options., Oodles of our devices by a general symbol SIN are represented, with strange names (or eight names, if they are our E71) and only two devices we tested a real stage, device supply, the population was only with the battery and storage technologies., ?It's simultaneously a testament to the insane diversity of devices Microsoft has to deal with, along with the implicit reliance on vendors to provide drivers in a logical and consistent manner., We don't imagine the Device Stage will be populated with truly useful infos on our favorite devices for many months (or years) to come., Overall speed / stability
Speed is one of Windows 7 main selling points., is especially set for netbooks, Windows 7 can turn a machine almost unusable on Windows Vista (especially if she was struggling with manufacturer's own crapware) in a fairly powerful workhorse., This is partly to do with the kernel stripped-down Vista operating system, as has a smaller memory footprint, but also rework the Microsoft GUI-clockwise, which means less congestion and fewer moments responding., On the machine you are well equipped with up-to-place upgrade of Vista brought to (trust us, a clean install is worth it to learn from our mistakes), we found in Gadgets a while to load at system startup slowdowns when we were a bit "too much" with the media, Internet Explorer, and I felt very sad over the competition., While streaming Windows Media Center to our Xbox 360 we had trouble maintaining an internet connection, or perhaps a network connection -- it was unclear which was dropping., Our worst experiences, however, were with a clean install to a quite modern netbook., The OS became increasingly unstable over time -- Windows Explorer itself seemed to be the main culprit -- and the machine eventually failed to boot entirely., Luckily, the Startup Repair utility managed to jump to the rescue and found a System Restore point that booted fine, though we lost the few customizations we'd made up to that point and were face with basically a fresh install again., It was nice of Windows 7 to recover itself so well, but we would obviously have preferred to not run into that issue in the first place., But there are still some decent options for most people, and if you've gotten a jump on things you might have already scored yourself that $50 upgrade -- don't you feel smug?, In the long run, most people will end up getting Windows 7 with a new machine, so perhaps it doesn't matter so much, but we still wouldn't mind if Microsoft did a bit more work trimming down these full version pricetags., Wrap-up
Where Vista felt like a sprawling mess, Windows 7 has patched the holes and feels like a tight, uniform mechanism., But most people on this planet have a way of interacting with Windows on a regular basis, either by choice or necessity, and Windows 7 is great news for the millions of souls., Instead of a change in the formula is Windows 7 really an extension and refinement of the true principles of Windows (we just made): the broad hardware compatibility sets, ease of use coatings on deep functionality, and "everything" on the function and SKU., With these broad objectives, and so different userbase, it's no wonder that there are many points where the operating system is still far, but overall it is clear that Microsoft has taken a strong step forward with Windows 7 The world is on 22 October know., Password Recovery

It's a problem that plagues almost every computer user at one time or another., Computer memory refers to the physical devices, The organization of data in a machine or computer is referred to as computer memory., Information is stored on a computer in much the same way as the human mind does, hence the term "computer memory", Get Rid Of Hard Drive Diagnostic - Keep this fake diagnostic malware Off Your PC, One of the parts on a person's computer that most regularly fail is the hard drive., A combination of moving parts and continuous access from everyday tasks not to mention things like power surges and heat buildup all can cause the files on your hard drive to become just disorganized all the way to damaging the files and making them inaccessible, The mobile operating system is about to overtake the world with its abilities., Many types of information are delivered now, thanks to this new phenomenon., How to find out Windows Vista Login password, One of the cornerstones of Windows Vista is security., Vista comes with User Account Control (UAC) system, firewall protection against malware, spyware, phishing filter, automatic updates, and, of course, that the procedure for logging into your account and password., All this is a great security and gives you peace of mind knowing that your system is protected, surfing the Internet., Windows XP Operation system &#40;both Professional and Home versions&#41; have a "hidden" administrator account., When you have installed Windows Vista first time, how long did it take you to realize that you lost the administrator's password?, Firstly, if you forgot Windows 7 password, you should need a Windows 7 Password Recovery Disk., You must be looking for a good password manager for Windows 7 since there is no such build-in tool., I have been using Secure Password Storage for a few weeks, but the functionality is limited, the choices too are limited, and the app as a whole is sometimes quite slow and buggy., You are missed, and the Start menu is full of articles for our productivity., To be honest, we do not know what state the planet pride not on our operating systems robust functional people from Redmond have over the years, and while Windows Vista is showing in a position that Microsoft does not "t invincible he has not to show anything, such as Windows one idea - and more of a necessity - it's all in danger., Find out Windows 7 Password!, Bypass Windows 7 Password!, Crack Windows 7 Administrator Password!, An administrator password in Windows 7 is the password to any account that's setup to access administrator level functions in Windows 7., Here, RAR Password Recovery 5.0 may be your best choice., Here, ZIP Password Recovery 5.0 may be your best choice., bombermanneo has 17 articles online, ?1997-2010, Active Network, Inc., This October Microsoft will release Windows 7 world-wide,, the ActiveWin.com Team spent some time testing the Windows 7 (RTM), available in stores and new PC?s around the world (that goes for Intel, you out there might be hearing about Windows 7 a lot lately, some, Windows 7 delivers three key attractions: improved, release of Windows 7 promises to get the most out of today?s hardware, discuss the three advantages that will make your move to Windows 7 be, first became aware of Windows 7 a little bit after Windows Vista was, Windows 7 was previously, Microsoft knew what Windows 7 which had been re-code named "Windows, be a Service Pack, an incremental update and a number of other things., the first alleged build of what was purported to be Windows 7 leaked., next few months, alleged Windows 7 pre-release builds continued to show, cool, definitely looking forward to that improvements., the frenzy that continued to build for what Windows 7 would become,, Then in October of 2008, Microsoft officially unveiled, Windows 7, which became the official name for the next generation, the discussion, 'Is Windows 7 a major upgrade?' Is it another overhaul, use features that first appeared in Windows Vista?, Finally, the day of PDC 2008 arrived and people were, looking forward to the first official demo of Windows 7 in months which, with a brief introduction discussing what Windows 7 was all about, along, Ten months later, we arrive at Windows 7 RTM?, Reduce disk and memory foot print., Exceptional hardware and software support., Bring future releases to market faster., The release of Windows 7 promises to go back to the basics of what a PC, core benefits, you can expect an OS that gives back as much as it takes., Windows 7 takes a different approach by actually, Windows 7 is not just about looks, the Windows Team has, The Taskbar for instance, is more intuitive, productive and provides, subtle ways of working with programs that will make using the PC, When you use a feature like the new HomeGroups, which makes it easy to manage a home network with just a password, users, for instance, the initial setup phases focus on getting Windows, Also, users are more informed about what is, happening as Windows 7 upgrades their system providing a more, Businesses can appreciate some of the benefits and synergies Windows 7, includes when deployed together with Windows Server 2008 R2., Search Federation is also another hallmark that, Although Internet Explorer 8 has a new battle to fight with 4 energized, browsing the web, from integration with the new Windows 7 Taskbar with, Internet Explorer 8 is a productive, yet fun experience., has also made Windows give users more choice about how they take, programs that once came with the OS to Windows Live, the OS provides the, Windows 7 is a major release I look forward to using and benefitting, Contributor Network
		Aug 25, 2009 "Contribute content like this., Start Here.", Although Windows 7 is not officially released to the public until October 22, 2009, it has been released to MSDN subscribers., The version that has been released and that I have been using is WIndows 7 RTM also known as, ?release to manufacturing also known as going gold in which the operating system starts to become released to manufactures.After using Windows 7 on multiple computers and making the switch from Windows Vista, I take the time to comment and consider whether or not the new Windows 7 is worth the upgrade.Let me start out by saying that I was never impressed with Windows Vista., In fact, I still had Windows XP installed on both my laptop and my desktop computers., Recently, I built a new desktop and used Windows Vista Business 64 bit version for 3 weeks since Windows 7 had not yet been made available to me., Windows Vista is a memory hog and this was evident on my sister's Lenovo laptop with Windows Vista and 2 GB of ram.The laptop just never worked well., It was slow, sluggish, and the boot time was even slow than my laptop running Windows XP., However, the technology and hardware in the Lenovo laptop was significantly better and newer by several years.I formatted the hard drive, after backing up important files, on the Lenovo laptop and installed Windows 7 Professional 32 bit., From the get go I was very impressed with the speed improvement and less memory that was being used., Now it is much quicker and I prefer using it over my laptop running Windows XP.I also upgraded WIndows Vista 64 bit on my new desktop to Windows 7 64 bit, both professional versions., I was glad I could do the upgrade instead of the clean install which would have required me to format my hard drive and reinstall all programs., However, Windows 7 is picky about being able to upgrade., You can not upgrade from Windows XP and can only upgrade for certain versions., For example, I could not upgrade my sisters Lenovo laptop from WIndows Vista Home Basic 32 bit to Windows 7 Professional 32 bit., You should refer to the official Windows 7 upgrade chart to help avoid confusion and determine what you can do., The review includes new functions and options, and compares it to the prior..., Windows Vista Compatible Anti-Virus Software, Many old programs have not been optimized for use with Windows Vista, but the major security players have stepped up with updated offerings., Windows Server 2008 is scheduled to be the next server operating system released by Microsoft., When installing or upgrading to Windows Vista, you have two options., You could either install a fresh version of Windows after formatting your hard drive or you can simply upgrade your current Windows XP operating sys..., After years of waiting, Microsoft Windows Vista has finally arrived., Although this article will cover reasons to switch over to Vista, it would be wise to consider waiting till your ready to upgrade your hardware or b..., Duel for Your Desktop: Windows XP Versus Windows Vista, Windows Vista: What's New?, The Six Editions of Windows Vista - Which One is Right for You?, Windows Vista: Don't Believe All the Negative Hype, A decline in market share and mind share has seen the software giant struggle to stay relevant amongst strong offerings from both Google and Apple., Microsoft's efforts in the Windows Mobile 6.5 era were desperate and sorely lacking third party applications, basic OS functionality and support for the ever changing mobile hardware., All devices must have the following at a minimum:, In terms of additional hardware requirements, the device must have a back button, windows button and search button on the front of the device., These strict guidelines for manufacturers help maintain a consistent user experience across the range of Windows Phone 7 devices., For this particular review Microsoft loaned us a Samsung Omnia 7., The device also sports the minimum 1GHz Qualcomm processor, 5MP camera with 720p video capture and 8GB of storage., Development is only one part of the structured ecosystem., In the past Microsoft has allowed third parties to replace the UI on the device., The problem is some devices have the standard UI, others have an OEM custom UI and others have parts of the UI replaced by operators., Third party developers aren't sure what part of the UI to write to and it has created a confused user experience for end users., Lees believes that Microsoft isn't controlling the UI this time around, it's simply doing it in a structured way so that third parties can add value and differentiate themselves without compromising the end user experience., One thing we noticed here at Neowin is that you'll need to be careful when you pick the Windows Live account that you first add as this ties itself to the core of Windows Phone and you cannot remove it later on., Why Microsoft has made this decision is unclear, but for those with multiple Windows Live accounts you can add them all to the phone but the first one will be the primary account used for Xbox Live, marketplace and music/video hubs., Microsoft says that all third party apps tiles will be single width., The company had to make some design decisions to create double width tiles for applications like calendar and pictures., Although third party app developers will not be able to create double width tiles, OEMs and mobile operators will be permitted to create them., You can pin applications and people to the screen and I fully expect Microsoft will extend this further in later revisions of the operating system., The ability to pin your favourite contacts makes the phone extremely personal., Windows Phone 7 really feels like it's alive in the palm of your hand., If you scroll to the bottom of the home screen then the arrow at the top slides sideways to point you in the direction of the classic look., Across the top, you'll see indicators for signal strength, connection type (3G, EDGE) and whether Wi-Fi or Bluetooth are enabled and battery status., Information such as emails, text messages, missed calls and voicemails are all provided straight on the lock screen., The lock screen allow users to customise the wallpaper and also see latest calendar appointments, including their location., Calling/SMS

	Calling and text messaging (SMS) is as you would expect on Windows Phone 7., Dialing is simple and you have direct access to the People Hub to select your contact., Instead of using coloured bubbles to differentiate incoming and outgoing text messages, Microsoft has opted for a minimal design., Small little speech bubbles point downwards for outgoing SMS and upwards for incoming., MMS picture messaging is present alongside the ability to send to multiple recipients., You can also forward texts by simply holding your finger down on them and selecting the forward option, this copies the text into a new message., People Hub

	If ever there was a Facebook phone then this is truly it., This functionality is extremely powerful and compelling for such a device., We found a few things we'd like to see Microsoft address in future releases to increase the usability of Facebook but overall it's a great experience., Games Hub

	The games hub of Windows Phone 7 is the part that will excite any seasoned or casual Xbox Live gamers., If you setup your Windows Live account on the device it will pull down your Xbox Live information and display your avatar within the games hub., The Extras app also lists your online Xbox Live friends, why this functionality wasn't baked straight into the games hub isn't clear., A number of big names have signed up to provide Windows Phone 7 games., The marketplace, at the time of writing, includes games such as Frogger, Star Wars, The Sims 3 and Uno., Unfortunately since the marketplace is in test mode at the moment, we've been unable to fully test the functionality., Marketplace Hub

	Marketplace is the name of Microsoft's application, game and music store for Windows Phone 7., You can access the store from the Marketplace app, via the Xbox Live Hub and the Music and Video hub., Microsoft has gradually been approving a number of high profile applications during the test mode marketplace that Neowin has had access to., Applications such as Foursquare, Shazam, eBay, IMDB and Seesmic have all been recently released., Hitting the search button allows you to narrow down your search but the final results mix in applications, games and music so it's often hard to find the application you require., We can imagine this would become a bigger issue for those who are app crazy and load on? large amounts of apps., Microsoft's answer is to pin apps to the home screen but this only shifts the problem elsewhere., We're hopeful that a local search for applications will be provided in future OS updates., Our limited experience with the IMDB, Twitter and eBay apps shows that third party developers are embracing the metro look and feel throughout their applications., Most applications feel like they are part of the operating system.?, The Music and Video hub offers a one stop shop for all music, video, podcasts, radio and marketplace content., The software will ingest a range of different formats such as MP3, WMA and AAC etc., Zune doesn't support playlists from iTunes or DRM content but fully supports Zune's marketplace content., Microsoft says the reasoning behind this is to prevent considerable battery drain when syncing large amounts of content., DivX and MKV formats are not supported natively but we fully expect third parties to offer separate applications for these., The music and Video hub also tracks your YouTube history and provides this to you within the hub., Windows Phone 7 users can also take advantage of the Zune pass subscription service which provides unlimited music streaming for a set price per month., Pictures Hub

	The Pictures hub is the central place to interact with photos on your Windows Phone 7 device., The Facebook integration is solid in pictures, allowing you to save photos locally and comment on friends Facebook images., We'd like to see Flickr available in the pictures hub, fingers crossed that will become available in the coming weeks., Office Hub and Internet Explorer

	Microsoft has also included an Office Hub for Windows Phone 7 users.?Office Mobile allows you to access and edit Word and Excel documents on the road., The Office experience on Windows Phone 7 is leaps and bounds from Windows Mobile 6.5., Outlook email provides an unread filter and users can also flag emails and navigate between messages quickly., Despite not using the Webkit mobile standard that most other devices rely upon, Microsoft's implementation is solid., Microsoft claims it's one of the fastest browsers on the market., Internet Explorer supports up to six browsing tabs and standard pinch to zoom features., You can also double tap to columns where columns will be snapped and small amounts of text word wrapping is applied., Microsoft does not have an extensibility model inside the browser for Flash or Silverlight yet., We understand, from company insiders, that this will change very soon and Flash is on the cards in the next few months., The lack of HTML5 support could be an issue in future but Microsoft is likely to have updated the browser before HTML5 is wide spread., And the rest..., For example if you type "th" it guesses that the next letter will likely be an "e" or "a" and increases the target size of those characters., For example if you type "Pizza" and swipe to local then you'll get local pizza restaurants wherever you're currently located., Microsoft has hard coded the search button to Bing in the OS and has no plans to open this up to other search engines in the future., There's no options to ask for a password after 15 minutes or 1 hour of inactivity., You can use your voice to call people, start apps and search the web., The lack of copy and paste will annoy some but Microsoft has promised an update to address this and other issues in early 2011., On the plus side, the functionality the device has for social networks and the personal experience is executed extremely well., The concept of hubs and tiles pays off across the operating system and provides a seamless and integrated experience for consumers., Although the operating system has a number of issues and feels like a work in progress in some areas, we're confident that Microsoft will address this quickly., Windows Phone 7 devices are extremely compelling smartphones at a time when many will be considering their holiday purchases., Yes, it's a giant step in the right direction and one that the software maker will back with funding, support and development., Stay tuned to Neowin as we dive deep into each individual feature of Windows Phone 7 in the coming weeks., Please Log In or  Register to post a comment., Please enter your reason for reporting this comment., -  20 October 2010 - 22:59

With the launch of Windows 7 in the market, Microsoft has given new dimensions to the word "operating system"., Right from driver support to multitouch groundwork for the future, from better battery management to the most user-friendly interface, Windows 7 has all what is required to take computing to the next level., Launched in 2009, Windows 7 has totally covered up the inadequacies of its predecessor, Vista and is totally amazing., It totally lives up to the hype and the implicit expectations of Microsoft users and is worth of every penny that users have invested into it., Let?s take a quick look over various features of Windows 7, which makes it ideal for every computer user:

New Taskbar

Microsoft has improved the navigation power so that you can access and launch your applications in a quick way., In addition to the apps on which you are working, you can have a glance on your most recently used applications., You just have to click on a shortcut to launch and re-click to close it., When you navigate your mouse over the apps icon of the running program, you will get thumbnail preview of entire apps window included in the taskbar., You have the power to close a particular window from the thumbnail preview., Hence, it is extremely helpful users working on multi-windows at the same time., Jump Lists

Jump List will arrange your all frequently used files on your Taskbar shortcut., Applications which favor Jump List will be displayed when you right click on the short-cut., New Shortcuts

Now, you can have a fast access to any folder located anywhere on hard drive, network or even in the cloud, because Windows 7 presents smart Windows Explorer., Libraries

A library has been integrated with every application, so that similar files can be kept in an organized and collective manner at one place., They are located in different places on the same computer which are easily accessible., Different libraries can be fused together to keep their content in one which is extremely useful in sharing of data and other important media files., Thus a lot of overhauling has been done in the Vista to ensure better performance., Hence, Windows 7 is a good replacement for it., Windows 7 ReviewiYogi offers an ongoing series on Windows 7 Reviews providing easy to understand information mainly focusing on the usability of applications in Windows 7., Use the feedback form below to submit your comments., Use the form below to email this article to your friends., Advantages of Windows 7

Computers & Internet ? Computers & Internet Articles, since the comments are truncated i can't read your reply fully., well i bought a new dell studio 14 laptop and got windows 7 home premium with it., 7 works pretty nicely and i was able to run encarta premium dvd 2008 without any hiccups at all..., Thank you for your kind comments, The official release of Windows 7 is only a few weeks away, and if you?re anything like me, you?re probably asking yourself what effect this will have on your lives., Or will it be more of a low key affair, maybe involving the cast of Friends and a degrading video?, So I decided to apply my powerful brain to the problem, and find out what Windows 7 would mean for you, the average user., With only pre-release versions and betas available for download, to get a copy of the actual release version, I had to turn to eBay, where leaked copies have shown up recently., $150 and two days later, a package of bubble wrapped, technological delights arrived on my doorstep., So, my attempts to get my money back from UR_a_Ediot67 were at a standstill., So below I present my review of "Windows 7.?

Installation
Very difficult., The install for Windows 7 comes on four floppy disks, and as my laptop doesn?t have a floppy drive, I was worried I?d have to travel 10 years into the past to find a computer that did., Fortunately, my local Best Buy was offering a USB floppy drive for $80, which, not withstanding certain recent software purchases, struck me as the greatest ripoff the world has ever seen., I'd advise anyone wanting to install Windows 7 on their own machine should make sure their hardware can support it., After that rocky start, the rest of the installation went relatively smooth, although I had to fiddle with the BIOS settings to get the floppy to boot., After the install, the computer rebooted without incident, and I was up and running., I don?t have any particular exotic hardware on my system, but Windows 7 still struggled to find drivers for basically everything., Screen resolution was limited to 640 x 480, and my external mouse didn?t work because apparently Windows 7 doesn?t have USB support., Finally got the Internet working!Included Software
Windows 7 comes packaged with Internet Explorer 2.0, which I will admit to being a little disappointed with., It can render text and images however, which if you think about it, is probably the most important 40 percent of the Internet anyways., So be advised that to fully utilize Windows 7, and experience all of its weather checking glory, you?ll require some pretty specialized telecom equipment., Long File Names
While checking the manual, I noticed that it also promised that Windows 7 would be able to handle long file names., Start Button
The classic Windows Start button is back, and it works pretty much the same as you?re used to., You click it, and a list of programs comes up in a branching menu., Taskbar
The venerable old taskbar is back in Windows 7, looking a little retro, but otherwise in good shape., Curiously, the useful Quick Launch bar seems to have disappeared., The improvements made to the most recent version of Explorer were one of the bright points of the whole Vista debacle., The version on display here in  Windows 7 is remarkably spartan, lacking many features users look for, like thumbnail previews or frequently used shortcuts., To test performance, I ran a stress test consisting of a word document, two Internet Explorer windows and Minesweeper., Possibly related to the previously mentioned hardware difficulties, I found stability to be a real issue with Windows 7., Overall
In general I was highly disappointed with Windows 7., Additionally, the hardware incompatibility and stability issues that have long plagued Microsoft OS releases appear to back in full force., Unless you?re one of those deviants who always has to have the latest OS, or have very specialized faxing needs, I?d strongly recommend avoiding Windows 7 until at least the first Service Pack is released., 5 Animals That Can Do Amazing Things ...]
